I LOVE LOVE LOVE Burger's Priest.. and even better I love the wall of grease across the road from the original location on Queen east, you have to check it out it's the funniest thing ever..you know it's a good burger if it's left it's mark across the street along the sidewalk ...I would Highly recommend having a Burger at this place..you won't be disappointed ..","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I won't be going back to this location EVER again the queen east location has thankfully kept their menu the same, and I will be heading back there next time I want a great Pizza..I say fire the chef, who btw smokes, so limited pallet. go back to what works, lower the prices and the old money crowd will return, I was astonished that I was able to get a reservation at 7:30 that should have been my first clue something was up, 3 months ago you couldn't get a reservation at this location until after 8:30 9:00 it was so booked up.. I feel sorry for their WONDERFUL staff, they are forced to SELL this new menu, to customers only to have the disappointing Food arrive, 35 min's later, which is now way way way longer than before..and it's COLD too boot.. I  have to say that over all the experience was disappointing and it's a shame because.. if it ain't broke-don't fix it..the place was excellent as it was, it didn't need to be shee shee foo fooed all up..","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

TO which I was told \"I don't think I can,the cooks like it loud\" !!!  I mean REALLY? I'm only going to be in the place for the most 45 min's, you mean you can't lower the volume of the music for 45 min's? So I can enjoy a meal I'm Paying for!!  So let's finish the story, they lowered it a TINY bit, for 4 min's then a song one of the waiters liked came on, and he proceeded to turn the music back up, So again I asked if they would be so kind as to lower it, to which they turned it down soooo slightly that it made no difference at all..and after about 5 more min's it was back to it's original volume..at that point I was pissed beyond belief so I rushed ate my food and as soon as the last fork full was past my lips I left the restaurant and walked out the door, and my husband who was also bothered by the LOUD music didn't not leave a tip..

When we got there, the windshield had a crack clear across it, for which they said they were not responsible. They said it was there when we took it in. Or they dropped a wrench on it. Whatever.

She made the appropriate recommendations of treatment and products (without being pushy) and then I saw Brenda for my treatment.

Noel the front desk person is the most hateful, temperamental, and the worst attitude of any front desk person i have ever encountered. She cancelled my appointment because i couldn't get back because i had the flu and was downtown and didnt get he msg oil i got back and it was after 2 so she took it upon herself to cancel it so when i called she was locked and loaded to spew out nothing but bitter hateful rants, which ended in I'm hanging up the phone now. Who does this? Before this she said she would ask and get back to be considering the circumstances but didnt of course so I'm going to make my way down there to talk to the Dr himself.

Dr Greene was my Physician and well he was great, nice guy, very professional and hate that he retired because i was treated the way nobody should be a person who goes into the medical field to help, i take it Dr. ILHEM REMMOUCHE has no qualms in making patients suffer and changing their meds before seeing them and the meds i was on are  ones you cannot just quit, you have to taper down. She didnt care anyhow long story short Dr. Greene did care and stayed way past his retirement date and that shows he cared for his patients and it wasn't a paycheck. As for Dr. ILHEM REMMOUCHE i have never been treated and put in danger by a physician in my experience, she gave me 1 a day for a month instead the 4 i was prescribed and said she wasn't going to do much more anyhow, so i switched Drs immediately and found a compassionate Dr. at the MMG downtown. Her secretary is a joke as well good luck hearing back from her, don't know if she's stupid or just doesnt care.

I had an awful experience here and I want others to succeed in the workforce so I have some helpful suggestions for the owners of this establishment.\n1. Teach your employees customer service skills. I was not greeted or acknowledged when I came in the store. I was ignored. All you have to do is say, \"I will be right with you\". I watched this happen to many people. Maybe you could have customers take a number to stay organized.  The young man that helped me was nervous, had poor eye contact and didn't know how to interact with me. This is not his fault. It is his employers job to teach him these skills. There were at least 4-5 other disgruntled looking ladies, not helping or interacting with the customers either. It seems like a group problem.\nBe organized and work as a team, or at least pretend to be. I was told my service would take 5 minutes. I waited for 45-50min and observed this young man help multiple other costumers handled in the same way. What really upset me was I could see all the other ladies in the back not doing anything. Maybe they were working on other projects, but all I saw was lots of bathroom breaks and chatting. I think if you have people waiting you need to work as a team to get stuff done. I finally approached the desk, he looked at me and walked away. No \"I will be right with you\", nothing. They all looked at me and did nothing. I hate when you are paying for a service and they act like they are doing you a favor. He finally came back flustered, I think he thought I was going to yell at him and couldn't remember what my order was. It was waiting there. I don't know if he did it or one of the other ladies did it but no one thought to check to see if it was there and he wasn't told. \nSo in a nutshell, train your employees in customer service and come up with an organizational system. It would be nice if there was a nicer waiting area and better lighting. I feel like Americopy has a loyal customer base, treat them better. You could really benefit from some of these changes. I would love to come back and have a nice experience.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

With that being said the food is meh. It is neither good nor bad. My boyfriend and I were hungry so we tried one of the combo platters made for two. It had steak (salty, chewy, and overcooked), chicken (seasoning was minimal and it also was overcooked) and lastly pork (this was the best meat on the plate). It also included white rice which was ok and some plantains. I ordered the empanadas....one beef and one chicken. This was the highlight of the meal. Beef was better but I did enjoy both. Lastly, you are supposed to get bread with the meal....like many restaurants it comes before your meal. I asked once we received the main course and our waitress said that they were out. Probably something you disclose at the beginning of the meal. Well come to find out, they were not out. I'm sure she noticed my unhappiness with this news and came out a minute latter saying that they would have it right out. So basically she lied.....not sure how you go from being out to all of a sudden having some stashed in the back??? \n\nNeedless to say probably won't be coming back.

I should have stayed to look at a rug we bought off of the floor before he folded it up but Ray our sales associate was really pushy to get us to grab the car. Needless to say he was a nice salesman but he knew that the color would be off where the furniture had been sitting on it and where all the traffic from buyers would be stepping on it. Usually when it's too good to be true it is! Orig. $399 and got it for $160.....but we'll see if we can steam clean it and get some of the stain out. So don't give RAY (Asian guy) your business.....we bought a $2500 sofa set as well and he could have at least tried not to dupe us into getting the measley few dollars more commission and told us the rug wasn't worth it. Cmon man....honest living...be good to your buyers that's how you get repeat business. Instead now I have to put you on blast for being dirty! Please take into acct what others have said. The customer service was great for the most part but when you spend $2500 and you can't even tell the buyer that a $160 rug off of the floor isn't worth it, you are scraping the bottoms of people's pockets to fill your own.

It is extremely convenient to my home\/work so I figured I would try them out. Well, this was my mistake. I did not do any research, which is very unlike me, so please please please read this! \n\nTook the car in for an initial estimate, was told ~$2,000-2,500. I get it, they haven't taken the car apart to see everything that was wrong with it so more than likely it would be more. Was told the front bumper, headlight, radiator, air conditioning, and a few other things. I left that day to think over what I wanted to do and about a week or so went by and I decided to just take it to have everything fixed.\n\nYes I was told they could not give me a definitive date. I was ok with that. They proceeded to tell me that the adjustment to the initial estimate went up to $3,400. Ok, I was covered for the majority of this so I said ok. Come to find out when all was said and done that they had charged my insurance $6,200. I was never notified that there were additional costs and my insurance company was even quoted around $5,800 or somewhere close to that. Kind of shady.\n\nMoving along, this is where shit hits the fan! I brought my car in on July 9 and dropped it off at 7:30am. I was told I would get a call back that evening for an update. No call. I call back the next morning and they tell me that they haven't completely finished looking over my vehicle and I would get a call back by lunchtime......no call. I finally receive a call at 5pm to tell me that they have ordered the parts and they would arrive at the beginning of the following week. By Tuesday they call me to tell me that all the parts have arrived and hopefully I would get my car by the end of the week. No car. I spoke to Jacob and he told me that sometimes when they have other cars that they are trying to get out and are closer to being finished that they would need to stop working on my car and attend to them first (not something you tell a client FYI) Also, they told me my AC would not be covered...not what they initially quoted me. So, I patiently await, another week goes by,By this time it is now Friday, July 24. They call to let me know my car is available for pick-up. So my bf goes to pick it up for me, the radiator that they replaced is leaking......are you kidding me?!?! So the GM says that they need to fix the issue. I had called their corporate office that Friday evening bc I was so livid. I received a call back from Kevin Holmes (DM for Abra) the following week trying to rectify the situation. Initially they were trying to get me to pay for the part out of pocket at cost with no fee for labor ($650-750 I cant remember exactly) Absolutely not! After he talked to the GM and realized that they almost gave me a car back that was still broken, they offered to pay for the AC to be fixed. And yet another week goes by that my car has to stay in the shop for them to replace the radiator they already replaced and fix the AC issue.\n\nKevin Holmes was the only good thing that came from this situation. He took over the situation and became my point of contact. If I could give individual reviews I would give him 5 stars and the auto body shop a 2.5. When I came to pick up my car on August 4th (yes I said AUGUST) the gentleman (Dana) was not interested in anything but getting me out of there. I had to ask him his name as he did not introduce himself and neither ladies at the front desk greeted us. Customer service is what your business is based upon and there needs to be some serious makeovers at this location. \n\nSoooooooo, almost a month later I finally got my car and i waited a little while to see if anything would go wrong before writing this review. OH! Almost forgot, was sent multiple emails about taking a survey but when I tried to access them I was denied and it said link no longer exists.......how convenient...... \n\nHope this helps, I would not want ANYONE to go through what I did.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The dry rub was quite unique, not horrible but def not anything to rave about. We also had the pork belly sliders. This one item was the favorite of the evening. We opted to not have the pimento cheese on there and that was probably for the best. I'm not sure why but a lot of the items seemed to have pimento cheese.....\n \nSo I had the steak sandwich. Not a fan at all. There was too much going on. I actually had one item taken off of the sandwich and it was still too much. It was really messy and not enjoyable to eat. \nWe also had the roast turkey. Seemed dry to me but that's not really anything new with turkey. It came with hummus but we opted for it to be on the side. Honestly I don't think it would have added anything to the sandwich. In addition we tried the burger. Meh. The FF though were quite delicious. \n\nI will say that the menu is limited and seemed overly crowded somehow. Each dinner item had so many ingredients and none of it really drew me in.

The decor is very beautiful and our service was excellent. \n\nWe started with the champagne duo which was a 2006 Dom and a Krug for $90. The Dom was great but similar to many other champagnes like Louis Roderer, Perrier jouet, etc. the Krug was outstanding! We loved it and it was the first Krug we've ever had. \n\nWe both opted for the larger tasting menu. We also did one premium wine pairing and one divine. The amuse bouches were good but not great. Out of all the items we had, the only things that really stood out were the fois grais and the Krug. Everything else was just ok. \n\nAnother gripe was toward the end they decided to 'downgrade' my champagne from Krug to Laurient Perrier and 'upgrade' my boyfriends so that we would have the same champagne. The Krug was exceptionally better so we wish they would have left the original pairing. Also, we asked to revisit the Krug at the end and the waitress had to go check to see. They did it for us, but you would think after spending $1000 for the bill for 2 people that would be no problem!\n\nMaybe it's because we went to Joe Beef the night before and every single dish we had was mind blowing and the wine was fabulous for 1\/3 of what we paid here, but we would not return anytime soon. It is a fun dining experience and I would recommend it for a special occasion, but I am more about the quality of the food and wine above all else.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Marcus not only had an amazing, professional, calm, and cool personality - he paid attention to things that compare to a three Michelin star restaurant. He made some great food recommendations and when we told him we were interested in some of their wines, he sought Christina, the sommelier to our table. Christina and Marcus worked in sync together to perfectly pair our foods and wines. We had the oysters, slow poached farm egg, Parmesan bacon ravioli, gem salad, spring pea soup, Maine day boat scallops, veal cheeks, ginger cake, and chocolate torte (in order). We had about 6 wines total (we spilt them so we could sample more) and every one was perfectly paired with our feast. \n\nOur water glasses were never empty and Christina and Marcus made us feel special and well taken care of. At one point, one of the bussers removed one of the appetizer plates before we were finished and Marcus appeared like a ninja with a new plate and said 'I am so sorry about that.'  Seriously - what other waiter would notice something like that?! It's the fine details that impressed us. \n\nOverall, we feel Sage is one of the best restaurants for both food and service in Las Vegas.

The streets were very quiet.  We went into the restaurant next door to Beijing Restaurant Inc but RAN OUT as soon as we saw their LUMINOUS sweet and sour chicken!  You probably could use it to illuminate your way out of a coal mine with that!!!!!!!  Was not too keen on Beijing Restaurant cos I am not a fan of northern chinese food (think thick doughy chewy dumplings!)- but then I was tired and hungry and I really did not want to walk around looking for food.  So it was off to Beijing next door.\n\nThink the restaurant was named \"Beijing\" to sound Chinese but the food is more cantonese hong kong type cooking - nothing to do with northern chinese cooking or Beijing for that matter.  The owner spoke cantonese too.  So it was a good thing we walked in.\n\nThe food was excellent.  The portions were also huge so you are better off ordering just one dish per person for 2 or even share 2 dishes amongst 3.  Plenty!  The beef dish was tender and had that cooked over a high flame taste.  Yummy.  The fried shashimo with salt and peppers was delicious!  The congee was smooth and comforting as well.  Yum!  The free dessert of cut orange slices was a good end to a terrific meal.\n\nThe decor is simple but the place gets kinda crowded and you may be asked to share one of the bigger tables.  Was there late at round midnight and they were still doing a brisk business.  Great tip - they are opened till 3 am!  It seems like a lot of people come in for late night supper takeaways too.\n\nQuality is excellent quality and the prices are reasonable for the quantity as well.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

What we did get to order was nice but frankly not as \"awe-inspiring\" as I had expected after reading all the great reviews of this restaurant.  (So I am spoilt!) Nonetheless, the food was good and well worth a try.\n\nFoie Gras Cromesquis - basically a foie gras liquid croquette which was a tad too sweet for my liking!  Give me a nicely seared piece of foie gras any day. \n\nStuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras - you really have to attack this as soon as it reaches the table - hot foie gras with hot pork is great.  Not so great when the pork cools down and you get that wiff of gamey pork smell.  It was hard to take after that. The portion is really huge and you might do well sharing this instead.\n\nDuck Magret in Mushroom Sauce  -  I have never seen so much mushroom served with duck magret before!  It was not a \"SAUCE\" as much as a generous serving of sliced mushroom piled on top of the beautifully seared duck.  Nice touch. The duck was tender and cooked to perfection.\n\nOrder your desserts early cos they might just run out of what you want.  The pecan pie was delicious - lots of nuts and smooth syrup base without the gritty sugar bits you get from some pies.\n\nThe service can get kinda slow but the food makes up for it.  Try it if you are in Montreal and remember to make your booking early.

Why did I fire Dr. De Los Santos? Why will I never go to this clinic again? \n\nIn a nutshell: severe incompetence of doctors, poorly run clinic, rude receptionists, the walk in doctors are inexperienced and unprofessional, Dr. De Los Santos is extremely rude and unhelpful and appointments are unnecessarily rushed or rescheduled. \n\nOut of a nutshell: see stories below\n\nI am 27. In pretty great health. Maybe I would wind up here once every 4-5 months for something over a 2 and a half year span. Here are the stories of some of my visits:\n\nMy experiences with their walk-in doctors:\n\n1) Me seeing young female doctor\nMe: \"I have this bump on the inside of my finger\"\nYoung female: \"it feels like a ganglion cyst, you can google that and look up some treatment options\" \nMe: \"I'm sorry, google it? \nYoung female: \"yes, there are videos on how to smash it with different objects, like a book.\" \nMe: \"I googled that before I came here and it is supposed to be dangerous\" \nYoung female: \"well, you could just wait to see if it goes away. There isn't really anything we do for it here.\" \n\n2) Me seeing middle-aged male doctor\nMe: \"So, I dropped a weight on my toe. Went to the hospital and they x-rayed and it's not broken but the swelling is so bad I can't even lower my foot, let alone put weight on it, because it feels like my toe is going to explode\" \nMale dr: \"you need physio therapy. My buddy works over across the hall. I'll set you up with him, he'll take care of you.\"\nMe: \"they said at the hospital that I would need a hole drilled in the nail to relieve pressure and that any family doctor could do it. That's why I came here.\"\nMale dr: \"no, physio is what you need\"\n\n(2 weeks of agony and very expensive physio later with this doctor's \"buddy\" my the skin around my toe starts blistering with blood pockets and I go to my physiotherapist appointment):\n\nPhysio guy: \"whoa...that's not good. I don't think I should treat you while it's like that, let me get my doctor friend to take a look\"\n(He brings in the same male doctor from my walk in appointment) \nMake dr: \"oh wow, you need to have a hole drilled in the nail to drain that\" \n\n(I lost the nail in my toe which could have been prevented by relieving the pressure early.)\n\n3) Me seeing a young male doctor:\nMe: \"I am pretty sure I have a yeast infection.\"\nYoung male: \"oh. Ok. Well...we can uh..well we can do a quick pap, I guess. Um.. Ya. Ok. Is that what you want? Does that..I mean, that's probably the best idea. \"\nMe: \"ya...ok\"\n\n(He pushed my thighs further apart instead of asking me to do it then did the usual stuff but then took out the speculum and put two fingers in my vagina and felt around like he was looking for my g-spot. I've had someone feel around for abnormalities, but this was like i was getting fingered. I have never had a pap that included that sort of nonsense. I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life.)\n\nSo...needless to say, I stopped going to the walk in. I thought I would stick with Dr. De Los Santos (my Family dr).\n\nThen came the referrals. Referrals for everything. Sometimes 5 minute rushed appointments and 1-3 referrals elsewhere, every time I went. I am in general good health by the way, just low iron and some allergies (hence all the blood tests). I have been rudely rushed out of my appointments and felt like I was an absolute inconvenience for being there.\n\nThen I made an appointment with De Los Santos to get results for allergy tests. The clinic is a 3 minute drive from my place down Strachan. (Silly to drive, I know, but it was a freezing day in winter). I left about 10 minutes early. (Always plenty of time). Then bam, I get behind a truck that is trying (and failing) to back up into a parking lot, blocking the whole street. It was taking forever so I called to let them know that I would be late possibly. The receptionist asked how long and I said, maybe 2 minutes, it won't be much. She said \"ok, that's fine.\" I park in an open spot and run in. Yay! I am only 1 minute late. I wait at reception for probably another minute (with one person in line in front of me and three people behind the desk, I might add). I finally hand them my health card and a nurse comes over and says, \"oh, Dr. De Los Santos has already taken another patient since you were late. You'll have to reschedule. If it's an emergency you can see a walk-in doctor.\" At this point it is 3 minutes past my appointment time. I was just livid. \n\nNever, ever, ever again will I go back there. I don't care if you can instantly heal the blind and make them see, no one has the right to treat people the way she does. And the other doctors there should still be under the supervision of someone who knows what they are doing.","useful":8,"funny":5,"cool":0},

I just kept thinking, \"But I paid for a full year!\" \nI should have trusted my gut. Instead I lasted 4-5 months. \n \nI bought a Groupon for a year of unlimited laser hair removal on my upper lip, underarms and Brazilian. (I feel like so many bad reviews on Yelp start with, \"I bought a groupon.\" Will we ever learn?)\n\nThe short version: \nAnother reviewer put it best: \"The place itself shows many signs of wear and tear, especially in the treatment rooms and didn't feel particularly clean.\" \nThe floors are cracked and dirty, items in the room are also dirty and old. \nI experienced some of the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  \nIt seemed like they didn't know what they were doing during the procedure either. I don't know if it was a lack of confidence, or just a true lack of experience, but I felt really uneasy. Especially when I had to take off my underwear and expose my lady bits to someone who didn't inspire confidence. \nThe procedure was also extremely PAINFUL! I nearly jumped off the table over and over. I wouldn't consider myself a wuss. This may just be the procedure itself, but it added to my feelings of uneasiness.\n\nLong version: \nBefore my first appointment, I had never gone for laser hair removal before so I called ahead to ask if I needed to prepare in any way? The receptionist said, nope, no special preparation, just come as you are. \nOk... So I showed up with about 4-5 days worth of \"Stubble\" on my bikini area. (I read some online reviews for the procedure that said they usually ask for some hair growth). \nThe technician took one look at my hoo-haw and suddenly looked worried. \"Oh, you did not shave,\" she said. \n\"No,\" I said. \"I called to ask if I should, but they said I didn't have to do anything.\" \n\"Oh,\" she said. She remained quiet for a minute or so then went out of the room and came back with a disposable razor. \nOH ya. You guessed it. She had me dry-shave my under-business in their treatment room. With one leg up on the sink, performing a balancing act worthy of thunderous applause, I dry-shaved my crotch in their sink. \n\nIt just got sillier and sillier as the appointments went on. \n- I showed up a few times and the door to the clinic was locked. The owner would come back to tell me she had just \"popped around the corner.\" Apparently she \"pops around the corner\" a lot? Especially when there is a client scheduled to come in at that time. \n- Rough, scratchy papertowel was always the only thing available to wipe the gel off my face and other bits. \n- I called one time to change an appointment, but after 15-20 minutes of waiting on the phone while the receptionist flipped back and forth between times, I said she would have to call me back. The only call I received was days later from a different receptionist reminding me of my upcoming appointment (The one I was trying to change). I told her I was trying to reschedule days ago and no-one got back to me. She proceeded to lecture me about not giving them enough notice. \n\nThe final straw was when I sat in the treatment room, with no underwear on, for 30 minutes, while I listened to the technician deliberating with a client outside about schedules. They even had a receptionist, but still no-one even came in to say \"hey, sorry, it will be a minute.\" I finally put my clothes on and walked out. \nF-That noise. \n\nThe result: The hair removal worked somewhat for a bit while I was going to the appointments. It has been two months since I last had a laser hair removal treatment and everything has grown back to how it was before. Save your money and your skin. Don't do it. Or at least don't do it here.","useful":14,"funny":0,"cool":0},
