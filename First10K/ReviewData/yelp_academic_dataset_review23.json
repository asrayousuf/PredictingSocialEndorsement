I think 2.5 would be a fair and accurate rating to give but 2 is my only option here. \nYelp considers 2 to be \"Meh. I've experience better\" what a great way to sum this place up.\n\nOur first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a \"faint\" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.\nOur second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.\nOur 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. \nOkay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.\nUpon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. \nDay 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?\n\nDay 2\nGoes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.\nSo it's 10pm, (12\/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. \nI click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute. I wait 5 minutes and call back, she tells me they haven't forgotten about me and hangs up again. I wait 30 minutes and call back, reminding her it has now been over 30 minutes, she apologizes and says she will personally go check on why the hotel wont accept my money for a movie (not those exact words, but seriously..) I wait another 30 minutes and start writing this review. I have now been waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes including the writing of this review.. I'm not one to give up but honestly. I give up Circus Circus, if you don't have customer service or accountability, you do not have a hotel.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan\nPrior customer service manager of 3 retail stores and now traveling","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":0},

I'll say upfront that I know little to nothing about cars or their upkeep. I took my 19 year old Caravan in because there was a major leak from under the hood. Not only was Damien courteous but he didn't make me feel like an idiot for not knowing more about my vehicle. I have literally been scoffed at, looked down upon and taken advantage of by other service centers but not here. Pep Boys was honest in their assessment and totally understood why I would not have the costly repair done. I have FINALLY found my auto repair guys (for at least as long as Damien stays there) and would highly recommend this shop to anyone who, like me, knows nothing about cars and is tired of feeling that they are being taken advantage of and looked down on. AND to top it off they're charge for a quote was beyond reasonable. They could have dinged me to death with fixing one thing and then saying that they found another, and another, and another like I have experienced over the years from other auto repair places. What a relief to know that the next time I have a car that needs something done, I do not have to go through that nervousness and fear, I just have to got to Pep Boys on E.

I did not sign and asked the receptionist if I could hold off signing until I had at least MET the Dr. She informed me that the Dr. would not even speak to me until the form was signed. So I informed her that I would not be staying for the appt (even though it meant another hour and a half home by bus and starting all over again with a different Dr.) I can't believe people actually sign something like that having never met the Dr. It is like having a 'friend' set up a blind date and the date calls and says I'll pick you up Friday at 7:00.

Fortunately there were only 3 people in front of us at 4pm on a Wed, so we only waited approx 15-20 mind for seats. Upon sitting down you can see the authentic kettles and masses of incredible seafood being prepared deftly by one chef. Lobster, crab, mussels, clam, brandy, garlic - ever delicious Cajun ingredient being expertly boiled, simmered, seasoned and prepared to perfection. I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible! Huge and plump and looking so fresh, we will definitely be ordering a dozen to share next time! \nI had the combo pan roast level 6 of spiciness and JJ, the chef that prepared our food, cooked and spiced it to perfection.  It definitely had a kick and every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly - lobster, shrimp and crab. My girlfriend had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and it was spicy, brothy, and delicious. The pasta seemed very fresh and drank in the smoky, spicy broth amazingly.  The portions were huge and we left with enough food to eat for at least a meal or two later.

For dinner, we asked our server what she recommended. The sea bass was so highly recommended by our server (Amber) that 3 out of 7 guests ordered it. When we started eating it, the 3 of us were shocked by how flavorless the fish was and the side \"salad\" it came with was a mystery to all of us. We weren't sure if we were eating corn or noodles or weird oats. We all returned our nearly $40 dishes and ordered new things. The waitress messed up the order and split the scallop ravioli between the three of us. The scallops were chewy and the thick cream of the sauce left me feeling nauseous. The server had a really hard time remember our requests throughout the entire dinner.

If I could give Equity Trust  zero stars, or less than that, I would.

Equity Trust MADE EXCUSES AND LIED  about having to check an issue with the IRS before transferring my  cash from my IRA account to my IRA account at another firm.  I threatened to contact the OH State Attorney General Office.

Ok, this one is a bit long winded, but a definite MUST READ. My AC went out over night on a Saturday. I called One Hour when I woke up at 5:00 a.m. to see the ac wasn't working. They said the earliest they could get to me was from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m early Monday! Well, I guess I had no choice. Lucky for me Sunday was filled with Thunderstorms so the high was only 95.\n\nGuy ends up coming at 1 a.m. making Monday's work day awesome....\n\nFlash forward to Monday afternoon when I get off and come home. The AC wont go down below 77 now. Call back, they come see me Tuesday between 6-10. \n\nEverything seems to be working fine when now come Saturday again, the AC stops working again, turning on for 15 seconds, then off for 15 seconds, and over and over, not going below 77 again!\n\nBottom Line: It is impossible to get a time for them to come out. They are can get nasty on the phone when you tell them their service is unacceptable. Plus, nobody can tell me why the heck they have \"One-Hour\" in their name! \n\nSide note, I paid $7,800 for the A\/C unit from them and it isn't even 4 years old and I am having these issues. Plus, I get my vents cleaned by them and all.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The service is impeccable and incredibly knowledgeable.\n\nThis is not  priced for the faint of heart - $100 for the 5-course menu \/ $175 for the 8-course and $250 for the 14-course menu.  I will say as others have posted, don't think that you'll be hungry after this meal, we ordered the 5-course and were full.  The dessert was AMAZING and was accompanied by a chocolate flight.\n\nSide Note - Conrad is - I believe - the Manager - and he was sensational - a great host and ambassador for the restaurant!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2}]
