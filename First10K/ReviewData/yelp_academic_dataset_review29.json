We moved to the area in the last year, and were missing our old downtown sushi joint, when Ume opened just steps away from our condo - so we decided to give it a shot.  We noticed immediately that the prices were quite reasonable, and that there was a wide menu selection even beyond the sushi, so if you are dining with a sushi newbie, there are plenty of non-threatening options.\n\nWe have always had excellent service, and have always been offered a private booth.  We are always offered something complimentary - sometimes it is miso soup and edamame, sometimes it is an extra appetizer.  We have done both dine-in and takeout, and we are always greeted with the same excellent service.  \n\nI've also noticed that the restaurant is doing a lot to improve itself since the opening - there has been the gradual addition of decor and nicer menus, and over the summer, a new patio.  It is nice to see that they are not just coasting, but are actually investing in creating a better and better dining experience\n\nA definite thumbs up!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The serving staff was busy, but extremely good -- no water glass was ever emptied, she checked back frequently but discreetly to make sure we were take care of, and the food arrived within minutes.  My husband had a hamburger platter with french fries, and pronounced it very tasty. I had a short stack of pancakes (not really fluffy, but still good, and HUGE), and what turned out to be a generous side order of bacon. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes.

We're recent arrivals, and were so disappointed with the dog park in Champaign -- basically a boring piece of dirt with a bedraggled tree or two  surrounded by an entirely too short 4 ft. fence. Someone suggested checking out the Urbana dog park (they have reciprocity between the two parks) - it's like night and day! The Urbana park has several wide swaths of open, grassed area that is perfect for dashing around, frisbee, tennis balls, or just running for a dog's sheer joy of running.  The grassed areas are punctuated by some meadow-like areas of prairie grass, which was pretty in the late summer with wildflowers, although I was a little nervous about the possibility of snakes.  There's a very welcome wooded area with benches -- some really lovely big trees provide shade.  The park is well-cared for, with lots of mulch in well-traveled areas, lots of doggie bags (but only one trash can, by the gate - still trying to figure that one out), fresh water, a hose for those \"roll in the dirt\" days, and even a port-o-potty for humans who can't hike a leg by the nearest tree. There's a separate small area for small dogs, too, but it doesn't seem to be used very much -- a lot of people bring their small dogs into the \"big dog\" section, but it would depend on how comfortable your dog is around other dogs. \n\nWith our escape artist dog, who considers any fence a challenge to be conquered, we were especially concerned about gaps in the fence, so one of the first things we did was walk the perimeter carefully.  Any areas that look as though a dog might be able to quickly dig under have been blocked with large rocks, and the gates are well-fitted, preventing a dog from nosing out in gaps caused by sagging gates.  And the fence is a good, 6' high chain link--perfect for jumpers like mine. That 4 ft. fence in Champaign would just be a suggestion, if mine saw a squirrel on the other side.  \n\nThe picture on the Urbana Parks website, http:\/\/www.urbanaparks.org\/facilities\/55.html,  is a horrible one and makes it look like an urban wasteland.  Click on the video on that page, and you'll see just how pretty this dog park is. Yes, there is a fee -- contrary to what the park website says, we were only charged for a half-year when we registered in August.  $38 per year for the first dog, or $5 to visit.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Nothing available 'til later, but they did invite me into the sanctuary while I sipped their flavored water, ate an orange, and relaxed.  Their spa water tastes way better than the hotel tapwater.  The little spa store had some nice meditation music.\n\nThe little restaurant area to the right of the lobby as you walk in was a good place to relax and chat after a long day.  The food was good.  The waitress needed a bit of training on teas, though.  I had asked her if she had any herbal teas (as it was getting late and I didn't want any caffeine.)  She said she didn't, but she had green tea.  I asked if it was decaffeinated, and she replied yes after some miniscule hestiation.  I should have known.  3\/4 of the way through our snack, my eyes went wide as I realized I had more energy than when I walked in.  I reached for the tea bag and flipped it back and forth looking for the word \"decaffeinated\" on it and found none.  My fault too for not checking since I was given the tea packet.  I think the waitress did not know that green tea naturally has caffeine and has to be chemically processed to remove that caffeine.  I just ended up with a 2-hour bath to kill time 'til the next bleary-eyed morning.\n\nCheck-in was smooth.  My little casita was so far, I had to take a golf cart ride at night 'cause I didn't want to accidentally fall into one of the pools on my walk down while extremely tired.  Check-out took a bit more work as they had not credited my account with the appropriate discounts and I had to call the bellhop twice to come pick me up in his vehicle.

(They had the note in their computer but somehow it was never transferred to the actual account billing.)\n\nFor the restaurant billing, I think the waiter got our two bills mixed up since we had separate checks at our table of 2, for business reasons.  So, I got billed to my room someone's else's higher check.  Anyway, an hour later, I was checking out and noticed the odd charge.  I explained that it looked like the other person's charge and that mine should be lower.  They indicated they couldn't change it since I didn't have a receipt, even though I had just finished eating.  I just told them to hold on while I walked around the lobby to the restaurant.  The waiter was still there, cleaning up, and I asked him for his copy of the receipt.  He apologized for the mixup and turned around plucked one of the first bills off the countertop and handed it to me.  I gave it to the front desk, who then adjusted my account, and then I walked the bill back to the waiter.  All that could have been done by the staff.  (Or perhaps they didn't believe me in the first place.)\n\nBut like I said, I would stay here again, keeping all receipts and perhaps checking my account balance periodically.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Promptly, checked my account, and the charge did go through -        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n08\/31\/15 PURCHASE BAIZ MARKETP PHOENIX AZ CARD5867   $111.78 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt this point, the manager was dealing with it and demanded another payment. Meanwhile, I had called my bank (Wells Fargo) and they confirmed me the charge had gone through. I notified them about this, they still refused to do anything. They would not release the grocery and I could not just walk away because my funds were deducted. At this point, I have filed with my bank to reverse the charges. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClaim inquiry received\n\nATM\/Debit\/Prepaid Card Claim Reference Number: 70828151072\nRE: Debit Card XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\nWe have received an inquiry regarding your Wells Fargo account XXXXXXXXXX.

Once for me and once for the wife. Both were really BAD experiences in more ways than one.\n\nI'll address my last visit which occurred a few weeks ago.   Without getting into the medical details, let me say the waiting room was completely empty when we arrived, so we got right in.  The layout if the patient rooms is L-shaped while nurses station in the center.   After a doctor did the initial examination, we had to wait maybe 45 minutes until more tests were done.  That is not a problem, but what was a problem is the loud nurses outside our room discussing everything from their dates last night, to other patients.  Yes, they were talking about patients, and NOT in a good way.  There was do door to close, just a curtain, so it was pretty hard NOT to hear it. Very unprofessional.\n\nAs we waited another doctor we had seen before entered our room and told us \"good news\" the test result was negative for this one test.  He then leaves, and I start thinking, and I ask my wife, did you ever have that test?  Without going into details, my wife KNOWS she never even had the test the doctor just claimed was fine.  Sure enough, later on, another doctor comes in and actually does that test. \n\nDuring our time there we definitely had more interaction about the billing charges and how they would get paid then by doctors actually giving us useful info.  \n\nAs it turned out, they actually didn't do that well of a job medically as well.   Without going into details, they missed things they should of found.  Also, afterwards we get more than $1200 in charges from doctors that are out-of-network, or feel, for whatever reason they don't take our insurance, although this hospital IS in-network for our insurance.

So I'm being compared to the same size home, gas heat, pool, and where I work from home. Really.  We have this thing called the Internet that lets you customize things like this.  \n\nSo the account page gives me a \"breakdown\" of my charges.  $10 for water heating? Really, it is gas. No pool?

Do they really think we are THAT stupid?\n\nBut the best part is hidden on the back of your actual bill.  THEIR breakdown of where MY money goes. $7.14 - Customer account charge.

How come MOST companies provide an account for FREE.\n\nSo the bill says it costs them $33.20 to generate the electricity, and $22.86 to deliver it?

Were just talking inefficiency here, NOT actually paying for electricity.  \n\nAPS is great at at telling us a make-believe scenario at how we are using their electricity, but you don't see them telling us how THEY are wasting our money.   \n\nThis is a perfect example of how a lack of any competition can affect you.  Just like the medical industry, they can charge you almost anything they want.  You may think the Public Service Commission helps here but it does not.

It was interesting to hear what he said even though we had all been to Vegas before.\n\nAm I glad we listened to him! He told us to check out Mon Ami Gabi around 2:30pm for lunch in order to catch the 3pm fountain show at the Bellagio. We went on Sunday around 2:15pm and asked for a table outside on the rail (like the cabbie told us to ask for). They told us it would be a 45 minute wait especially for a table outside. But it turned into more like 30 minutes. We killed time at the casino ; ) \n\nEverything was perfect, except that is was SOOOO sunny and hot on this particular day, so we ended up rushing through our meal due to the fact that the seats \"on the rail\" have to cover above. Even with that, the service was perfect, the waitress was polite and fast and the food...was AMAZING. Two of us got the same sandwich special and my other friend got one of the club sandwiches. We all liked our food. Yum! The sandwich I had was chicken with pesto, grilled red peppers and yummy cheezy-ness! YUM!\n\nThe lunch prices were surprisingly reasonable for such good service and food, $9-$15! Seeing (and hearing) the Bellagio water show was so fun!\n\nMy recommendation is:\n1) During the day, ask to sit outside, but under and umbrella!\nOr\n2) Go for a super late lunch or early dinner when the sun is lower in the sky or dark : ) It must be beautiful then!\n\nHighly recommend it, but if you need a very specific time, call ahead and make a reservation so you get to see the show! Check out times here:\n\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1\/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes\n\nSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1\/2 hour\n8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The friends I was with had all been to the Hofbrauhaus before, so I was the only one who didn't know what to expect. We made a reservation for 8:30 on a saturday and walked right in when we arrived.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the HIIIIIGH ceilings and how loud it is. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.\n\nBut this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.\n\nThe prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.\n\nAnyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Show up Tuesday, one day late and wow was that fortunate because only a portion of my clothes were present, and had just barely arrived. One item was still at their other location because of some sort of equipment failure. OK, that's not great, things happen, but I wish I had known to just wait a day and not make two trips, but oh well. I am told they will send me an email as soon as the item is ready. Get the email the next day (now Wednesday) and make another trip to their location. Hand me a similar looking item, I pay before I look closely at it, and walk out. Halfway to my car I notice its not my item... Go back in, cant find my item, call other location they cant find it. I am offered a refund for my item, but when they find it because the store's clerk couldn't, or just wouldn't, process the refund.\n\nThis is my first experience with this cleaner, and it has been terrible.

The arugula salad with pancetta is our favorite but we also always enjoy the changing seasonal entrees. Each dish is a work of art and to truly experience it you must try to get a small bit of every little flavor on your fork to experience the artistry together. \n\nThe one complaint is a major one to us... the chairs in the patio area absolutely destroy your back! We are in our 30s and do not have back issues, but the metal garden chairs without padding are so terrible! It's a shame to spend $150+ on a dinner for 2 and leave in pain because of poor chairs. We learned this lesson early on and always asked for inside seating, but I hadn't been there for awhile and just booked a table through the website and ended up in the patio. I'm going to need to see a chiropractor after dinner tonight. \n\nIt kills me to say anything bad about our long term favorite place in the city, but comfort is an important part of dining and I think the patio chairs need to go to keep up with the quality and price that comes with the food.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Even simple dishes (prosciutto e melone) were clearly plated hours before dinner and had been sitting -- drying out and getting soggy at the same time\n\n- we asked for a wine list and our waiter came back to the table with an open bottle of a \"local favorite\" white - I asked again for the list. She set the bottle and 5 glasses down and walked away.  We didn't drink the wine and had to request it be removed from our bill.\n\n- once all courses arrived (at once), we never saw our waiter again - she was reassigned to another overwhelmed area of the restaurant\n\nIn short, the service and food were a disaster.

I waited another half an hour and called again asking why my vehicle still hadn't been started yet (this is now 1 hour after my appointment time) and they told me the delivery person for the hitch hadn't arrived yet with the shipment due to the weather. Okay, I can understand weather delaying people but by 1 hour!?!? Okay, so I wait another half an hour, as you can see we're getting a theme here! I called again and I speak to somebody else who tells me the other person had to leave to go someplace and pick it up.

Walked in and 5 girls were behind the hostess desk and we had to wait several minutes for 1 of them to acknowledge our presence. We were seated at a booth which was really nice and the restaurant seemed dark and needed a little more lighting and this was at 4 in the afternoon, the restaurant was steady, not quiet and not busy either. We were seated at our table and barely opened our menus and the waitress comes by to take our order - seriously - you take your time acknowledging us coming in the front door but want us to know what we want to eat when we've merely opened the menu!? We ordered our drinks and mine tasted like soda water not 7up, I sent it back and settled for water. The girl came back 2 minutes later and asked us what we wanted to order, we had barely found the page in the menu for the pizza selection and their selection isn't half what it was a few years back. Then she comes back 2 minutes later and asks us again at least by this time we had decided on the appetizer and decide to go with the bacon wrapped steak skewers. It comes to our table 2 minutes later, that sure was fast. So I select 1 and cut it open - OMFG! Not only was it medium or rare it was Blue Rare and the bacon was entirely Raw! So that girl takes it back to get it cooked properly. 2 minutes later we have the shift supervisor at our table apologizing saying it was undercooked, ya think!!!??? this was not medium steak people this was Blue Rare!!!! Yuuuuccccckkkkk!!! Afraid to eat any more meat here we decide to split a salad instead, you can't possibly go wrong with a simple salad can you. 2 minutes later our salad comes and it was alright. Then our pizza came in the middle of eating our salads and didn't even remotely resemble a heart, it just looked like a piece was removed from the centre top. She brought our plates out for the pizza just before the pizza arrived and all the plates on our table looked so or out and old and stained and chipped and in addition 1 of them was dirty!!

Finally I go in and he's helping another customer so of course I wait. Over 30 minutes of waiting and just needing 5 minutes of his time I ask if I should come back or how much longer he is going to be and the man blew right up on me. He couldn't just say come back later, he was busy sorry, or to see someone else - oh no he had to make a scene and yell at me and was quite angry with me for waiting quietly. I only wanted him to have some notice that I waited an extended period of time while he took his sweet time helping one other customer in front with paperwork. Miserable old man!

The place has a real old rustic feel to it, almost like you're standing in your grandma's kitchen. This is achieved by the thick wooden rusty tables and the wooden cabinet littered with books and interesting knickknacks.  The kitchen is an open one with a floral pattern dress wearing chef cooking frantically behind it. We were a bit put off that she wasn't wearing a hair net but let it slide. One thing I liked though was that this place had proper ventilation, so you don't leave smelling like the food as was the case at Mitzi's CafÃ©. We also loved that it was hidden in a nice, quiet residential area, always a favorite!  \n\nWe noticed that there was only one server on duty, which made the service less than impressive, but god bless her she was doing her very best. You couldn't really blame the server for this but instead the management for allowing one server on duty on a busy Sunday afternoon (the place was packed). Once seated we were served water right away and asked about our beverage orders to which we all said we'd have coffee. The coffee was the best damn coffee I've ever had in my life! And I've tried various kinds in my day between living in Europe and here. I even went to the trouble of taking down the name of the brand. As the service was quite slow, we had to re-fill our own coffee cups from the coffee station as well as our own water, which actually made the whole brunch experience more interactive as you almost felt like you were in a friend's kitchen helping yourself.  \n\nI ordered the salmon\/goat cheese breakfast wrap ($11), while the rest of the table ordered their own choices (all different). I have to comment on the freshly cut Paeonia arrangement in the middle of the table, my friend and I couldn't stop sticking our noses into them. The washroom was quite small but clean. Our meals came out 45 minutes after ordering but were delicious! The goat cheese complimented the salmon extraordinarily well; I was surprised at myself that I've never tried this type of pairing before. The rest of my table also expressed like for their meals. I was a bit disappointed though with the bland salad on the side. Although the leaves were all very rich in color, the dressing was nothing special.\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $35. Even though the service wasn't the best, I would still give this place four stars, for the effort put in by the server in doing her gosh darn best, for the amazing food, for the ambiance and for the general feel of the place. \n\nA definite place to return to, but perhaps a bit earlier next time.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":4},

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. \n\nThis time around, instead of just us two, we invited 3 more couples to join us. My first impression of the cafe was spacious with a nice plain brick wall and art work on the wall for sale, features I've noticed in other popular brunch places. One drawback to this place was their beautiful front counter was facing toward the wall; it would have worked much better facing toward the doorway with fresh cupcakes on display.\n\nI also noticed that no music was played in the background, a feature I enjoy. The menu was a foldout with two sides plus the back listing drinks, as they also serve beer. Our water was served plainly, although a nice jug full of water with mint leaves and lemons would have been an extra nice touch. I ordered the Big Breakfast ($11.95) and earl gray tea ($1.50). \n\nI'm guessing they were under staffed or I sure hope so because one of their kitchen staff sporting a hairnet was going around taking orders as well as serving food, not exactly eye pleasing. I hope this isn't their usual wait staff head wear.  \n\nAfter 30 minutes, our orders arrived, although the long wait could have been attributed to the size of our party. The portion sizes were massive, you get two sausages, two bacon strips, two eggs any way you want, potatoes, pancakes or French toast, fruit and pre-buttered toast. My poached eggs were on the runny side as I like mine to be somewhere in the middle. The bacon was good, but had no hint of any other extra flavor. The sausages were a bit overdone and dry. The potatoes were nice and crispy, the pancakes were nice and fluffy, however, none of the fruits in the fruit salad complimented each other and were instead all very separate flavors, you could tell there was no thought put into the dish. We also found the meal to be quite cool and not hot at all. My earl gray tea was served in a nice tea pot but was a bit on the thin side. \n\nThe bill for the two of us was $30, pretty good price for the portions that you get, but more suited for someone who just wants to be fed as opposed to someone who wants to enjoy what they're eating.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The moment we walked in, you could feel the buzz. It was quite busy, but we were seated right away. \n\nEach table was draped with a brown paper table cloth (similar to Jack Asstors style), with crayons for drawing. This touch made it a more family friendly place, as kids could draw while parents chatted with friends. I drew a tree : ) Underneath these table clothes were white linen, I'm assuming for when dinner rolled around.\n\nThe waitress brought out water right away, with a slice of lemon (without us ordering it) which was a nice touch. Most of us ordered coffee, which was served in a glass cup (very eastern European) and the large coffee pot was left at the table for our convenience. I found the coffee to be a bit on the watery side. About 5 minutes went by before the waitress came back to take our orders, a bit longer than usual, but not surprising considering how packed it was.\n\nI ordered the Lisa's Bloor West Village Special (a.k.a. Kielbasa and Eggs) ($11). I wondered if the owners were Polish, as kielbasa is a polish style meat, but our waitress told us otherwise. Our meals came out 15 minutes after ordering. \n\nI wasn't too happy with my meal as there wasn't anything that excited my taste buds. Even though the portion sizes were generous, the scrabbled eggs were quite bland, as was the  kielbasa. I was expecting it to be drizzled in a spicy sauce or something to kick start my morning, but sadly to no avail. The table side ketchup helped here. The cream cheese addition to the eggs was a bit awkward and didn't add anything to the flavor. The potatoes were also quite bland with no hint of any other taste besides...potatoes. My rye bread was nice, but nothing on the plate complimented each other. The fruit was disappointing, with half a slice of melon and pineapple. The melon was lovely and sweet, but my pineapple tasted like meat (I had to spit it out mid way). The rest of my party expressed similar dislikes.

After putting our name down on the waiting list and waiting 20 minutes for a table (we played the cross-word while we waited) we were seated next to the kitchen, which is an open one.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, although the table we were sitting at was a bit small. You can choose from ordering off their menu or from the blackboard above the cafe area. I found that the menu was a bit more simple to follow, whereas the board was a bit too confusing.\n\nWe both ordered the Mitzi's Breakfast Special ($6.95), coffee and a large glass of OJ (freshly squeezed, $4). We also found that sausage is not served here, but bacon instead. When asked why this was, the waitress simply said that they prefer to carry one type of meat. \n\nThe wait was about 15 minutes for our food, but the art work on the wall kept us entertained. The food was absolutely delicious!! Where do I begin? The roasted potatoes, mmmmmm, nothing like I've ever had before. Roasted in some kind of pasta sauce with a hint of vinegar. When I asked the waitress for the recipe, she kindly said that it was a Mitzi's special and that it cannot be shared, smart girl! The bacon was oh so good with a hint of smokiness to it. The toast was pre-buttered (nice!) and our poached eggs were just right. And for $6.95, what a deal!! $24 total bill.\n\nThe only draw back to this place was the lack of ventilation.

The patio was full so the service wasn't as attentive as in other places, but it was good nonetheless. We ordered pints and the Irish Breakfast ($15).\n\nThe layout of the menu was a bit messy and confusing to follow, with the brunch menu stuck near the bottom of the page overpowered by the snack selections printed over top them. \n \nWhile waiting for our meals, I ventured inside the empty cottage (as everyone was sitting out on the patio). Myself having spent several years living in Ireland and my boyfriend being from there, we felt that it really pulled off the old rustic cottage look and feel to the place very well, very similar to what you would find in the rural parts of Ireland. This was achieved by the thick wooden tables and log cabin ambiance. The bar was massive and from what I could tell, had a fair bit to choose from. The washrooms were also very nice and clean.\n\nOur meals took over 45 minutes to come out. Even though we were reassured by our waitress that it was being plated 20 minutes into waiting, when we asked another waitress at the 30 minute mark how much longer it would be, she revealed to our surprise that the Irish Breakfast always takes a minimum of 20 minutes from the time of ordering to be prepared. Funnily enough, this little tin bit of information was nowhere divulged beside the dish on the menu, or verbally once ordered. Frankly, we had no idea why it took so long, as it was the worst Irish Breakfast we have ever eaten, and we've lived in Ireland!! Oh, and it doesn't come with toast, if you want a side of it, it'll cost you $3! My boyfriend was not impressed hearing this after he asked the waitress for a side.\n\nWhere do I begin, the rashers, if you want to call them that, were like min steaks, way too thick and quite chewy. The beans were just that, beans, probably dumped out of tin can. My Irish boyfriend commented that their potato farl were definitely not made fresh as he's had so many back home, he knew the difference. Small portion sizes were also a voiced complaint among us. The black pudding was quite dry and so tasted like sawdust. I found the banger to be a bit too greasy, whereas my boyfriend found it edible, although he found it to be leathery on the outside. The fried egg was good, but really overall, nothing special here. There are better versions out there, trust me!!\n\nOverall, the service was good, the food horrible, however, the beautiful weather and patio seating made up for it.

My boyfriend wasn't too thrilled that most of their dishes served eggs scrambled and no other way, while other items weren't very brunchy as there were some spicy Indian style choices.

But seeing as the location is a prime one, I guess this makes sense. \n\nWe ordered the Breakfast Platter ($13) and were told that it was quite filling for once person, so for two it would hit the spot. And seeing as I always ate less than my boyfriend anyway, we thought this would be the perfect choice. As an add on to the dish, we could also choose a side of beef for $2, but we substituted for bacon and sausage. \n\nOur meal was delivered approximately 25 minutes after ordering, which was quite a wait considering it wasn't a busy morning (two other occupied tables). The pancakes were nice and fluffy, although our sausage and bacon were quite disappointing, with one and a half strips of bacon and two sausages the size of a pinky finger. The sausage was good with a spiciness to it which was lovely. Our eggs came out fried even though we asked for poached. \n\nAll in all, the Breakfast Platter didn't hit the spot at all, as we were still quite hungry afterwards. \n\nThe bill was $27 in total, although we noticed we were charged $3 for the one and a half strips of bacon and $3 for the two pinky size sausages. When we questioned this discrepancy (as it said $2 side on the menu), and our surprise at the ridiculous price, we were given an embarrassed shrug from the waitress. \n\nEven though the food was good, we will not be coming back.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1},

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. \n\nBecause of the beautiful weather, we decided to sit outside on the patio. It was about 1 in the afternoon but we were seated right away. I found the menu to be a bit too busy, whereas my boyfriend liked the layout of it. We were served water right away, which was presented nicely in a tall, thin jug. Even though it was our waiters fourth week on the job (he informed us later), he was friendly and efficient. \n\nI did quickly take a look at the interior. I really liked the unique layout of the bar area, a real eye-catcher once you enter. However, the rest of the restaurant had more of a diner feel to it accomplished by booth seating, which wasn't anything special.  \n\nWe ordered coffee ($2), which my boyfriend thought was a bit watery, fresh large orange juice to share ($4.25) and I had The Standard breakfast ($9.25) with poached eggs and bacon. Our orders came out about 10 minutes after ordering. The poached eggs were in their own little container, which I liked; less mess! Although they were a bit too runny. The bacon was not as crispy as I would like it, but very tender. The rye bread was pre-buttered (always a favorite), and the fried sliced potatoes had a hint of paprika on it which was lovely. I wasn't a huge fan of the green salad as it had no flavor to it; a bit of dressing would have made a difference. Although the addition of blueberries was nice visually and to the taste. I also liked the addition of a slice of melon; I have found it's always good to pair off greasy food with a bit of fruit as it seems to take away from the greasiness.\n\nThe total bill was $34, a bit pricey, but for the nice seats, beautiful weather and great portion sizes, it was worth it. Definitely a place I would come back to.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. \n\nIt being a busy afternoon, we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. One drawback to this place was the size of the hallway, with people ahead of us already waiting, we had no choice but to wait out in the rain.\n\nThe layout is very long and narrow, with a simple brick wall. Very few artwork on the wall though (I saw one in the corner) so nothing to catch your eye while you're waiting for your meal, although the bar was neat to gaze at. \n\nOnce seated, the service was fast and friendly. I ordered the Hardy Gal Breakfast ($9.95) and the cafe latte ($3). The latte was delicious but disappointing that it was served in a glass cup (as it makes it difficult to hold the hot contents). The menu was one page with the second dedicated to drinks. There was also a little section welcoming and thanking customers, with some history of the place included, a nice touch.\n\nOur meals arrived exactly 9 minutes after ordering, pretty fast, and considering they were full on packed, quite impressive. \n\nThe meal was good, but nothing spectacular. The bread was pre-buttered which I'm always in favor of. There was also a small shredded apple salad included which was lovely and complimented the rest of the dish nicely. When I asked for ketchup, it was served in a shot glass, hmm. Although I was satisfied with my portion size, the rest of my table was not. Total bill for the two of us, $30.\n\nOverall, nice food, nice buzz but a bit overpriced.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

And I just loved the cute little bar, back rest counter high white stools and a full drink selection. Only around for a year and a half, it seemed to already have made a name for itself, with its handful of cut out newspaper reviews proudly framed on the wall as you walk in (and the first thing you would see, which was a nice touch to the place). We guessed from the blown up photo of some dude in a chef outfit crossed armed and full of attitude was the owner\/chef himself. All this gave a nice personal touch to the place.\n\nOnce seated, we were served right away by an eager waitress. I ordered the 'Breakfast Special' ($9), although you're tempted to say 'I'll have the Breakfast Special 9' as the number '9' reads as part of the dish name instead of the price itself, perhaps something that can be improved on just for ease of clarity. After the fumble, we were reassured that many make the same mistake. Tea or coffee was included in the special, so I ordered earl gray tea, which was served in a small teapot compressor.\n\nThe menu was the actual table mat, blue and white in color with a fair selection of items. We noticed that their smoked meat sandwich's were a big hit, something to try for next time. We also noticed that the milk was annoyingly served in a small tin container, and there being 5 of us in total, it became a bit ridiculous asking the waitress to keep making multiple trips back to the kitchen to keep re-filling the tiny buggers!\n\nFour of the five meals came out after a 30 minute wait; my boyfriends came out 15 minutes after that. This was a bit annoying to be honest, but compensated for after receiving an apology from the waitress along with a five dollar coupon for our next visit (we're easily pleased) always a nice touch and appreciated. Although for that even extra nice bit of touch (going the extra mile as they say) it would have been even nicer for the 'don't mess with' owner\/chef guy to come out in person and apologize for the long wait. I never understand why some restaurants don't do this, it shows the restaurant cares just that little bit extra, changing the customers opinion of the place from 'I got a fiver for my next visit' to telling their friends about it. I saw Mr. attitude himself so he was there.\n\nThe meal was nice and the portion size just right. Eggs were a bit too runny, always a favorite! But their hash browns were yummy, complimented very well with the apple sauce addition. Their bacon was a bit too hard and their fruit salad was just that, fruit! Nothing really here to get me to come back, although I wanna try that meat sandwich!!\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $27, not bad for what you get. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot, I mean we do have that fiver :)","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2},

I was incredibly unsatisfied with fresh city farms! The amount of produce you receive is not nearly worth the money you pay, every time you have a question or an issue, their 'member support' number never connects you to a person and you have to leave a message which they rarely reply to, and the only option to pay is via pay pal which fresh city farms kept saying that there was something wrong with my credit card. There isn't anything wrong with my credit card, I use it all the time, so clearly the issue is with pay pal, but Fresh City Farms insisted that it was an issue with my card. When I e-mailed them to try to arrange an alternative payment option, I never heard back, even though their automatic message reply says they 'aim to reply within the next business day at the latest'. When they did finally contact me, it was regarding my outstanding balance and that I still owe it (which I already knew!), instead of a reply to my query regarding an alternate payment method. I had to cancel my service after two weeks and am in the process of looking for another provider.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0},

It was the worst experience of my life. Never ever go there!!!! Food was terrible. Service was horrible. My family used to go there at least once a month for years and years. But I can honestly say this location is a disgrace and should be shut down. We used to like it so much we chose this chain when we were on a family trip.  Being that it was always consistent. The experience I had will force me never ever to go back. Frankly I'm appalled at how much it has gone downhill in the past few years. They offered to comp my garlic bread for my poor experience. I said I would pay for it. I wanted the manager to understand I'm not trying to get a discount. I was complaining so she would realize how many things went wrong with my experience. \n1. Dirty table and booth\n2. Not greeted timely by the waitress\n3. Drinks were not refilled\n4. Garlic bread did not come out with app as requested\n5. Manager said ticket time for dinner was only over 30mins even though we put it in over an hour earlier. Claiming the food is put in after the app. Which is fine if the waitress courses it properly. However 20 mins after we ordered we were told that they were out of ravioli. And we're treated as if we were inconveniencing them. \n6. Manager talked to us and tried to be friendly but did nothing to speed up or improve our service\n7. The kitchen staff was laughing and yelling so loud I could here it from the dining room\n8. Bathrooms were a disgrace. Dirty and smelled\n9. Table tents were dirty \n\nI always patiently wait if I see my waitress is busy or I can tell the staff is overwhelmed. It was a Wednesday at 8. Maybe 3 tables were there and plenty of staff. I consider myself to be a reasonable person. I cannot fathom how this place is even open. The location is phenomenal. But everything else about this restaurant is gone. Save your money.
