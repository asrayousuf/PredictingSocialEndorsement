Steak was real steak, not pressed meat, but nothing to write home about otherwise. Cheese was alright. Bread was unremarkable. Onions weren't grilled enough for my tastes. Mushrooms were too tough and chewy. Flavors didn't really click or pop, so to speak. I just wouldn't order it again.\n\nOne of us ordered chili; she said it tasted like dog food.\n\nAmbiance is screeching chairs, crashing trash bins, and tourists with varying degrees of volume control, milling around a cavernous metal-and-tile cafeteria.\n\nThe highlights of my experience were the cups of free water and that one of the employees had on a cool Mighty Ducks hat.\n\nMaybe their ice cream and smoothie options are great; maybe the cheesesteak would be better with fresher ingredients or a different chef.

Maybe we got unlucky, or maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I ate at the DI location about a decade ago and remember it tasting equally disappointing.\n\nServers were friendly and helpful, even while comping half of our meal; chips and bean dip were above average, but so too were all the prices. Water was clean tasting if you care about that sort of thing. View is fantastic.

Couldn't tell who the chef was, but the only guy behind the counter was a young Hispanic guy. It tasted about as good as you'd expect if you went in thinking you'd get a thirty+ year veteran chef and got a young Hispanic guy instead.\n\nEither today was a serious off day, or the five star reviews you're seeing on this page were meant to be written for the Verrazano on Sunset.

Our server checked with management and gave us happy hour pricing on the burger just this once, which was kind of them. Service was nice, ambiance pleasant, and things came out in a timely manner. Their water was some of the cleanest we've had in a restaurant. The strawberry shake is probably the finest I've ever had ? but it had better be, for $8, you know? The burger came out well done even though I ordered medium, and it seems to be one of those pre-formed, pre-grilled burgers with a bunch of liquid smoke added to it. Aside from the patty, everything else about the meal was good ? but because of the patty, I'll never order that again, and I'd have been disappointed to pay $14 for it.\n\nIt's weird to give the place 4 stars mostly just for the great shake, super-clean water, and nice service, but here we are.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I don't mean an eye-wateringly powerful spice, or an interesting spice that added to the flavor profile, just an unadvertised \"I wouldn't have ordered this had I known in advance\" kind of spice. Beyond that, the flavors and textures didn't mesh or impress.

It was the sorriest enchilada I have ever seen. Maybe a quarter of an inch thick, with cheap cheese that melted into liquid grease. 100% unappetizing, and they wanted to charge three dollars for a single one. No sides or anything.\n\nMeanwhile I got their Thursday $5 special, the carne asada. It at least had a proper portion size. But the meat was chewy and tasted almost old. Beans tasted pretty good, but rice was very mediocre. The waitress insisted that everything is fresh and they go to the market every morning for supplies. If that's the case, then they've figured out how to take fresh ingredients and capture that mysterious and elusive 'slightly outdated' flavor that's so hard to achieve with fresh food. I only managed two or three bites before giving up.\n\nThe chips were alright but nothing amazing. We got two rounds of them, and the second round tasted fresher than the first. Salsa was alright-ish but lacked sophistication, and had a slight burn in the back of the throat that managed to drag on and on. Top this off with the water tasting either like tap or like their filter had gone out. We both drank from my tea, just to mask the dubiousness.\n\nSo far this is completely in 'Eek!' territory, so why 2 stars instead of 1? The waitress that day was great. But she's apparently one of the bartenders and was just covering for the Maribel's staff today while they were short. She was extremely understanding, and took off both the terrible enchilada and the disappointing carne asada. We left without being charged, but we still happily left a tip.\n\nAnd really, there were other patrons here who seemed to be quite happy with what they were getting, so I'm very confused about how lousy this was for us. I remember reading over these yelp reviews and wondering how you end up seeing a bunch of 4 and 5 star ratings and then an intermittent 1 or 2. I've definitely had a 1 or 2 experience today.

Naturally, I was quite nervous about the whole affair. \n\nI went in for a consultation with JosÃ©, who spent a lot of time going over options with me and trying to find a style that would work with my face. Not once did I feel pressured to cut it if I didn't want to, and it was obvious that he had a lot of experience in making the most of someone's hair.\n\nOnce the decision was made to start, he proceeded to spend a full hour trying three progressively shorter styles until we found one that made both of us happy. He made sure I wasn't given a style that would require too much maintenance (my previous hair maintenance routine largely consisted of washing it, brushing it, and tying it back, so I'm not one for too much fuss), but that could still be sculpted depending on my mood on any given day.\n\nHis enthusiasm and attention to detail really made the whole process quite exciting, and I spent the rest of the day getting compliments from people - none of whom had ever seen me with short hair. Even the other staff members (and clients!) gave their approval, which meant a lot after so long away from the scissors. We won't even go into the reaction it elicited from my wife, though I will say it made it want to cut my hair more often.\n\nI really can not recommend Funky Toque enough.

I called on the 20th, and was immediately sent to a voice machine, where they guarantee they will call you back within a short period, yet I received no call back. \n\nI called again the next day after shortly considering going to another spa- but couldn't find a place to beat the cheap prices at The Healing Arts. \n\nI signed up for the Pamper Me package- where you can choose three different combinations, so I got a 60 minute hot rock massage, a 60 minute Belavi Facelift facial, and a 60 minute hand and feet feast (reflexology massage).\n\nAs soon as I walked into the spa, I started to relax! It is dim lit, and smelled like the sweet heavens. I filled out some paperwork, was given water, and then taken into a room that was dim lit as well, with soft music playing. After taking off my clothes, I proceeded to enjoy an hour of amazing massage work by Terrell. She worked hard at extracting the stress from my body with her witch craft.\n\nAfterwards, I was treated to a facial in which I fell asleep during. \n\nAll and all it was a great experience! I'll be going back for sure.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":2},

I discovered that there are... or I just dug down and pulled what was left out of any willpower I had to do Echo Canyon Trail, and I finished.\n\nI'm overweight (working on it, give me a break!) and this was seriously a lot of work. \n\nYou may have seen someone sliding down the pole on the way down the trail... yeah that was me. I was too afraid I'd go rolling down it if I didn't decide to slide down on my ass.\n\nBe prepared, mentally and physically. Take plenty of breaks. Gloves can come in handy but aren't absolutely necessary. I highly recommend a camelback for water, it came in handy for sure. Bring a snack with you to eat at the top. \n\nGet ready to climb over boulders, and to constantly think.... oh! I made it to the top!! Only to discover its just another mini peak, and you have yet another half mile to go before you reach the top. \n\nWear sunscreen!! You will need it. A hat might do, but I feel like it would get in the way of seeing other hikers making their way back down the mountain. \n\nI seriously reached the point of exhaustion, and three days later, I am still sore. Even my back was sore after this hike. I also discovered a nice purple bruise on my buttcheek from sliding down some rocks...LOL.\n\nThe view at the top is absolutely worth it. Don't feel like you have to rush just because people are sprinting behind you. Move off to the side and let them pass. Take your time, rushing is only going to get you injured. \n\n\nOnly negatives I have:\n\nParking SUCKS. The lot was full at 8am when we got there, and it was really frustrating because 3-4 cars drove out at the time we were circling around, yet the people in charge of monitoring parking weren't paying attention. Instead of being able to drive in, we had to park at AJ's which was a mile and a half away. Apparently they only open up the lot every 10-15 minutes. You will be better finding a spot to park and just walking, otherwise you will spend more time trying to get into the parking lot than you would walking to it.\n\nIt's not a fashion show. I'm glad a lot of women are confident and proud of their bodies. But honestly, I don't want to look up to determine what boulder I'm going to grab, only to see half of your ass hanging out of your waistband rolled up neon shorts. I also don't want to look up and see your tits hanging out, on the verge of nipple flashing. \n\nSome people brought kids, and it's not really something they should probably be seeing. I'm sure the dudes don't mind, but really?? Go to a strip club if you want to be naked.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

I started working with Hali in the beginning and since we weren't quite sure what we wanted, and knew we needed indoor and outdoor signage, she referred me to their outside sales rep, Mandy. \n\nThings were good at first, Mandy came out to our location at no charge to do some measurements and get more information from me. She left after telling me she would get me a quote within the next day however, I did not hear from her for a week. After sending an e-mail to see when I would receive a quote- I got an e-mail with one the next day. After about a week of back and forth Q&A I told her we were ready to go forward with the project. I did not hear back from anyone after six days so  I sent Hali an e-mail on the 16th of September asking why I had not heard back from anyone, I finally got an e-mail from Mandy on the 17th; by that time had already decided to seek out another vendor. \n\nThe vendor we talked with quoted us almost twice as much as what Fast Signs did, so I will commend them on their pricing. \n\nI had to ask them to revise the proof they sent to me four times because they kept sending me incorrect proofs. The first proof that was sent wasn't even a proof for our company.\n\nWe paid half of the payment, and I let them know that we were ready to have everything installed except for one indoor sign, as we were repainting and doing some rearranging. \n\nThey showed up with only one sign to install, and nothing else. I asked them where everything else was and he told me that they said I only wanted one sign installed. I had to let him know exactly what my e-mail said, and after he called the store, the owner, Sam came out to help install the rest of the signs except for the one sign we weren't ready for.\n\nThe signs for our front door have a white border- in which I pointed out to another sign we have, as a reference to the width of the white border we wanted- the signs they printed have almost twice the size border we wanted. In the proof it did not look as big, so we approved it. \n\nAfter telling Sam about my issues with the slow response times, the multiple proofs, and the border width, he apologized, but offered no means to satisfy myself or my CEO. The only thing he offered was a 10% discount if we wanted to reprint the signs.\n\nIt is my belief that a company that offers a product or service should ensure a customer is 100% satisfied with it.\n\nI am extremely disappointed with the service we received with this location. Although the pricing is good, we spent a large amount of money on our signs. The low pricing reflects the low standard of customer service this location has, and I am not quite certain we will use them again.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Well, sorry dude, I just moved out here in July from Texas, so I'm going to trust a map that is on the listing website saying where the house is. My bad, could have done some more research, but you could have clarified it with me before I went to look.\n\nRude realtor, and untrustworthy in my book, I'm thinking if they are willing to let you go 40min out to look at a house that has no electricity, and looks like a poop bomb went off inside, they won't really give a crap about you if you move into a house and have any issues.\n\nDon't waste your time with this realtor, or this company.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We figured it was right next to the theatre, where we were going to watch a movie after, so why not? The dining area off to the right was pretty full, so we sat at a booth in the bar room. At first it looked like only one waiter was serving for the entire bar room. Finally, someone walked out of the kitchen and came up to us to take our drink orders.  I ordered water, and a lemon-tini. She came back fairly quick with our drinks, except I was given a tea with lemon... simple mistake, no biggie. We already knew what we wanted food wise, so we placed our order with our drinks- I ordered the boneless stripper wing platter with fries, and my boyfriend ordered a simple burger and fries. \n\nWe sit there and wait...... and wait..... finally, 10 minutes goes by and I still haven't gotten the lemon-tini I ordered. I look at the bar and see it sitting up there, and see the waitress standing off to the side watching tv. She glances at my drink, and then walks into the kitchen and comes back out to go over to where the menus are stacked and chats with another server. I get her attention and ask if my drink is ready, and she says, \"Oh! I'm sorry, I asked another server to run it for me, I guess they didn't.\" She of course, as to my guess, grabbed the drink I figured was mine that was just sitting there on the bar.\n\nUhhh what? You asked another server to run a drink for you, so you could watch the game on TV? Wow. \n\nSo then, we wait. And wait....... and wait. By this point we had been there for about a half our. A half hour, for some wings and a burger??\n\nMy boyfriend gets up and goes to talk to the waitress, who was again just standing there watching TV. He heads to the bathroom to wash his hands, while she goes to the kitchen to check on the food, and sure enough.... literally right after my boyfriend said something to her and went to the bathroom, she comes out of the kitchen with our food.\n\nHe comes back from washing his hands, just as she is setting the food down on the table. At this point I knew our food had probably just been sitting in the kitchen. I tasted a fry, it was hot... ok cool, lets try the wings.\n\nThey weren't even luke warm!!! The wings on the outside of the plate were cold. Literally cold, and the ones in the middle were barely luke warm.\n\nMy boyfriend bites into his burger, and what do you know??? Barely luke warm. \n\nOur food had obviously been sitting there for a while, for it to have gotten that cold. \n\nHe gets the manager, who asks if I want my wings re made, but at this point we don't have time because of the movie time. He said he would give us boxes to take it home, and he would take care of the meals for us. During this time, he was rushed and didn't really seem too genuine about his apology, and he hurried off. The waitress comes with the check, and we see that he only took the wings off of the tab.\n\nBull crap, we waited a half hour for some cold wings and a cold burger- and you want us to pay for it? Hell no. So I told the waitress flat out I wasn't going to pay for cold food. \n\nShe comes back with the revised tab, and I paid for the drinks. The manager comes back and gives us two $10 vouchers to visit any Native Bar & Grill. He then took the time to actually apologize, and seem sincere. I told him that this was our first time visiting. I've worked in the service industry for 7 years on and off, and was not impressed. He apologized again, and we went on our way to watch the movie.\n\nIDK what the deal was, the bar area was not that busy, while yes the dining room was, but that does not excuse cold food and a lazy waitress who just wants to watch TV. \n\nWe won't be going back to that location.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Not only that, the place needed to be OK feeding my dog her Raw diet and be a place I trusted to truly take good care of my girl.  Let's just say my options were very limited.  \nLuckily, someone recommended Doggy Boom to me and the rest is history.  My dog and I had a Meet and Greet with Antoinette at her place at Mt. Pleasant\/Eglinton and I was immediately impressed with how she understood my dog's needs and WHY she was behaving the way she does.  Not only that: She feeds her dogs raw as well!\nAs many boxer owners would understand: I have gotten used to automatically apologizing for my dog's behaviour.  We started with daycare with Antoinette and each day I went to pick up my dog, bracing for Antoinette to say: \"Sorry, this dog has way too much energy...I cannot allow her to come back\".  But each time I picked her up, I brought home an EXHAUSTED and better behaved dog.  Antoinette would tell me about their HOURS long hikes and how great my dog is.  I noticed a huge change in my dog almost immediately.  She listened, she has learned how to control her enthusiasm, she no longer jumps and most of all: she has learned how to properly interact with other dogs.  Not only that, I have also learned how to watch her interactions with other dogs and read situations.  All thanks to Antoinette we have a very happy and well-behaved boxer who loves her boarding stays with Antoinette.  I am so relieved to have found Doggy Boom and have a place that we can leave our dog for overnight stays without having any worries.  Thank you Antoinette!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

She's the type to baby talk your pet like it's the most beautiful cat or dog in the world (what owner doesn't love that?)! Hehe. She's very genuine about her affection for the animals! It's great. I got my 7 month old puppy neutered here, along with getting his nails trimmed, AND his rabies shot. I believe the total came out to $100 total. That's CHEAP! And it includes pain medication for 3 days after the surgery (during, too, of course, they are \"put under\"). The important thing to remember here is that THIS IS NOT LIKE GOING TO THE VET. Wanna go to the vet and wait 45 minutes for a full exam and all these things? It would be well over $400. I was checked in immediately, and the surgeon, Scot, took his weight and checked heartbeat, and that's it. Perfect. I also took my pregnant cat in to get spayed (don't worry, she was not far along at all, no pain was felt by the unborn kittens), and because she was pregnant the total came out to $105. STILL CHEAP! Again, got checked in immediately and was given 3 days of pain meds for her. The only \"con\" I would have is that they don't include the dreaded CONE. It costs $15 (any size). Dogs usually need to have these! Cats generally do not. Both animals are doing great, and considering you're paying a fraction of the cost that vet offices charge.... a lot of these \"low cost clinics\" don't treat the animals like the prince or princess they are! This clinic is the best option when you're not willing to pay several hundred dollars for the same surgery (and you should be!). :)","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan). \n\nThe problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.\n\nOregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff. \n\nSo after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table. If you're particularly unlucky, you may be served by the effeminate robotic waiter who avoids eye contact--he manages to be chirpy and rude at the same time, the worst of both worlds.

The combination was the most bizarre-sounding yet one of the best I've ever had. The sorbet was sweet and cold with a red onion twist. And initially, it seemed strange with the hot and cold, but it was perfect. The lightness, sweetness and tartness of the sorbet counter-balanced the fois gras. If I could go into a Baskin Robbins and ask for a red onion sorbet I would. I could easily eat 10 of these. The only other appetizer that can rival this for me is Michael Mina's tuna tartare.\n\nThe lobster pasta was nice and light despite being pasta. The serving size was just right, giving me a great taste of it but not over the top so that I felt uncomfortably full after (with not enough space for the rest of the menu). They gave a good-sized lobster claw and with the al dente paste, perfection again.\n\nThe beef cheek was incredibly tender - cooked just right. It was tender and juicy, on a bed of potato mash and gravy. I love beef tongue and the texture was similar, except it was a thicker meat. This was also very rich.\n\nLastly, the chocolate ganache was lovely as well. The coffee grinds and maple ice cream were a nice compliment and the ganache itself, light and slightly rich. \n\nSome friends also had the wine pairing ($95 for the tasting menu and $45 for the wine pairing) and the wines (including an icewine at dessert) they said were perfectly complimentary. They said the chianti served with the beef cheek was just right.\n\nMy husband was the only one not ordering the tasting menu - we were told that the signature ravioli was one of the best dishes so he decided to get that. He loved (and so did I). I would come back and try that as my main next time.\n\nThe service and atmosphere here were bar none. The server thoroughly explained each wine we ordered (including the single servings) and when our food was brought to us (we were a party of 8), there were 3 to 4 servers who laid our food down so that the rest of the table wasn't always kept waiting. Even as one of us went to the washroom, a server just passing by would pick up our napkin left on the seat and fold it nicely, leaving it back on the table for us. \n\nI'm so glad we came here and I would definitely recommend this restaurant and come back.

Of course, our ceremony was one of our main priorities in terms of ensuring that it went smoothly, but our reception (the food and music) were of utmost importance as well because so many friends and family attended.  So there were 2 things that we wanted to ensure we gave our loved guests - a beautiful outdoor ceremony (thanks Caesars Palace!) and a rocking party.  \n\nTom was fantastic from his emceeing duties, to the attention he paid to our song requests, to his regular (and not bothersome) follow-up's with us throughout the night to make sure everything was going well, to being accommodating for the surprise games that our guests had planned for us.  His mixes were also fantastic and he ended the night on a super high note for us.\n\nWe also went with photography and lighting services through them.  The prices for their lighting were incredibly competitive and affordable compared to others.  And the photographer they assigned to us (Jeniffer LaRocca) was fantastic as well.

I had dinner last night (a Wednesday night) and though it was busy (they had a huge group sitting), it was still as relaxing, peaceful and enjoyable as all of my other visits.  \n\nThe decor is modern chic with a relaxed flair - completely beautiful.  It might appear pretentious to some, but the amazing, friendly staff have always consistently made me feel warm and welcome (I never once experienced attitude by anyone).\n\nI was also there last Friday and was served by the same server, Katie, who was just as attentive, friendly and warm.\n\nBecause I'm a regular, I've tried a lot of different things (but not everything because to keep things fresh and moving, they do change their menu every once in a while).  \n\nMy go to appetizer is always the zucchini chips - fresh, light, not over fried or dripping in grease, perfect crispness and a great aioli sauce to accompany them.  My second favourite is the polenta fries (not great when they're cold, so eat while they're still warm!).  My husband loves their spicy tacos and though I hate spicy food, I did try a bit and they were good.\n\nI will always highly recommend their short rib main - the beef is so tender that you don't need a knife.  This meat will melt in your mouth and you end up needing to pull pieces away with just your fork.  It's the most tender meat dish I've ever had; also came with root vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy - perfect accompaniments (one friend substituted the mash with fries at a different dinner and it was nice, too).  To avoid myself from having it a third time in a row, my friend ordered it (gave me a small piece to share) and this time, I had the spaghettoni with seafood.  The pesto was great and it was nice and light.  Small scallops, but good size shrimps and definitely a good serving size.  \n\nFor dessert, I recommended the carrot cake to my friend and she loved it (I had some, too) and I ordered the phyllo-wrapped cheesecake with blueberry compote (to die for).  Both the carrot cake and cheesecake were incredibly moist, fresh, sweet but not too sweet and a good serving size.  I have a sweet tooth and though I love sweets, I hate when it's overdone and they do sweets here perfectly.\n\nThough we had finished our desserts and had just been chatting for a while, Katie attentively refilled our waters and coffee without asking and her great service made the experience that much better.\n\nIn the past, some of the other dishes I've had were the pizza (flat crust - nice and light), steak and frites (nice and traditional), salmon (also nice and light) and their burger (juicy, fresh and filling).  \n\nWe're coming here again...and again...and again...","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We also tried the mild and medium and they were enjoyable for the spicy eaters as well. The Cajun medium was spicy enough for our party, but the Garlic Butter was very disappointing - bland and borderline boring (the garlic was barely there).\n\nWe did the clams, mussels (huge), shrimps, fish & chips, chicken tenders, Cajun seafood fried rice, sides of corn and potatoes and 3 sizzling plate combos (1 with rice and 2 with udon; fish and chicken). Note that for the sizzling plate combos, you only get the additional seafood before 4pm.\n\nEverything was excellent. Definitely get the rice (so good) and it'd be perfect to go with a pound of shrimp and a pound of mussels (or whatever) between 2 people - just enough. FYI re: the sides - when you order corn, it's just one piece of it (not a whole corn on the cob - probably just a third), but the potato servings are big. Contrary to the corn, if you order a potato, you get a whole potato and they cut it in half, so order a potato side with caution. Wish they served more of the corn than potato. And better to have the corn\/potato mixed in the bag with the seafood and seasoning rather than on its own.\n\nThe sizzling plate combos were awesome (definitely worth getting, but go before 4pm because the extra seafood isn't available for dinner). The chicken teriyaki was perfect - nicely seasoned with big, chunky pieces of chicken. The serving size of the combos are huge, so you can go with an empty stomach, share or have some for take home. The udon noodles were nice and again, provided in generous portions.\n\nThe only downside was the consistency - we had also been to the location at Sherway Gardens and it was different.\n\nAt the Newmarket location, there were no buckets on the tables to dump the garbage\/seafood shells. The server said she would come by every so often to clean up the mess for us. This never happened and made the meal particularly messy (it's already messy eating there as it is). It was actually an ongoing complaint for our entire party. The food was good, but the constant mess and piles of seafood shells overshadowed some of the positives. Also, because we ordered so much shellfish, it would have been nice to have been provided with extra gloves without having to constantly ask. So the food was good, but the service could be improved.\n\nIn relation to the Sherway Gardens location, there were buckets on the tables (thank goodness) and the service was great. The only downside here was that the food was incredibly salty to the point where I wasn't enthused about visiting another location. I also had the non-spicy Captain's Boil shrimp here and my husband had the medium Cajun mussels and all we pretty much tasted was salt. So the food wasn't as enjoyable, but the dining experience was better (and much less messy). The only reason why we decided to try the Newmarket location was because of a family event and we're all big fans of Hot & Juicy in the U.S. (same thing, but American). What I liked about Hot & Juicy was not just the seasoning (not at all salty), but that they also serve softshell crab (yummm) and the service - they constantly checked on us, brought extra gloves without asking and they even tie your bibs for you! Okay, that last point is a bit much, but the service was exceptional.\n\nI'd try Captain's Boil again, but maybe another location to see if the seasoning might be different.

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in (most ethnic markets I've visited are small, crammed full, and not super clean) --this one was just the opposite.  They had a small selection of sandwiches so I ordered lemongrass pork to take home.  While waiting on my eats, I decided to browse.  While they had a vast array of merchandise--anything from fresh octopus to okra, it was nicely displayed making it easy to check out the great variety of items.  I love to cook, but I admit that many of the items I had no clue what they were or how to use them.  That's what made this place so fascinating for a culinary enthusiast.  I could have spent over an hour taking in the wide variety of items --they probably had more than 20 different kinds of soy sauce alone. If you're a fan of stuffed dumplings, they had a plethora to choose from.  I didn't check out their selection of loose specialty teas--they had many boxed varieties as well. \n\n I chose a few goodies for myself --my sandwich was waiting for me at checkout, and I had a chance to speak with the owner on my way out.  Seems this place has been here for about a year and the present owner purchased it 3 months ago.  I'll definitely come back when I have more time and am not so hungry.  Fast Fwd. to home-- the sandwich is delicious!  First,  I was impressed with the quality of the baguette--it was golden and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The pork was superbly seasoned and my sandwich was stuffed full of fresh cilantro, pickled diakon, and julienned carrots.  It was quite a bargain for $3.99!

Our food was not good. It wasn't in edible or anything, just not good. And my breakfast was enormous with two huge pancakes......I don't know, having that much food in front of me is nauseating. I ordered the \"mini\" for that reason.  The waitress only came back one time during our meal and asked us how our food was, but she was facing the other table, and then we sat for a long time waiting for our check after we were done.\n\nWhen we left, no one near the exit said goodbye or anything. I don't need anyone to kiss my butt or anything, but it was just a very unwelcoming place. And the food isn't worth leaving your house. \n\nStay home and have a pop tart, it doesn't say hello either and the quality is about the same.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":0},

So across the street we went to Latitude 41 N.  \n\nAfter being handed menus, we were already uneasy about our decision. The menu makes no sense. There are bar-appropriate appetizers, salads, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, burgers and breakfast. Oh, and smoothies were advertised on a chalkboard on the wall. I already knew this place would be bad since they didn't seem to specialize in anything. How could they execute well if there is such a broad (un)focus? \n\nWe ordered the artichoke bake appetizer, chopped salad and southwest quesadillas. I also ordered a mocha smoothie.\n\nArtichoke bake: Uuuuuuuuuuuuugh. Gross. It was sorta sour, had about nine artichoke leaves in it, and had more cheese on top than anyone needs to eat in a month. My boyfriend said the cheese was choking him when he swallowed. It was served with \"crispy tortillas,\" but really they had a weird malleable cardboardy stale texture.\n\nChopped salad: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek. Ick. It looked slimy. It wasn't, but it looked slimy. It was shredded lettuce, tomatoes, a little bacon and a little bit of cheese. It was already mixed... I guess I like my toppings on top in a pile so I can pick up what I want in each bite. The balsamic dressing didn't taste like much. They offered seasoned bread (which I asked for but didn't eat) or fried dough. I asked what fried dough was and the girl said it was pizza dough deep fried with sugar on it served with cinnamon-sugar butter. Basically a donut, she says. WTF? Why would I want cinnamon donuts with a salad? How dumb.\n\nSouthwest quesadilla: Ehhhhhhhhhhhh. Blah.  This had no flavor. How gross is it to chew something, get it mooshy in your mouth and not even taste anything salty or greasy or meaty or anythingy??? The description said there was chorizo on it, and I saw it, but couldn't taste it. \n\nMocha smoothie: It tasted like a frozen international delight. Made with a powdered mocha mix. What more can I say?\n\nThis place tasted like Applebee's is it's hero.\n\nThe girls working were very nice, I can't say anything bad about them. But, we were asked if we wanted our artichoke bake first as an appetizer, which we did, and all the food came out together. Minor goof in my book.\n\nThe absolute WORST part of the experience, was the 40-minute drive home. We couldn't get home fast enough, if you know what I mean.................\n\nBottom line: if you have to choose between hunger and Latitude 41 N, just go hungry.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

This may have been because we went a little early in the season, but even then, many of the trees seemed quite picked over. Also, make sure to bring cash or check because they do not accept debit or credit cards!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Make sure to stop by on your birthday to pick up a souvenir birthday mug and complimentary beer or beverage!

Located about four minutes from the airport, the venue has a large parking lot and variety of indoor seating. We sat at the bar because we were in a bit of a rush. The bar staff was great at recommending taps off of their menu and also provided us with various samples to ensure we picked a drink we liked. Although we did not order food, the couple next to us order multiple appetizers that smelt and looked delicious. We will definitely be going back to take a beer tour or try some of the other menu options!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They host a variety of local artists, in addition to having open mic afternoons on Sundays. What I liked most about this experience was the wide variety of mead flavors. I had never tried mead before, but the bartender made sure to explain the various flavors and the process involved when making mead. Additionally, their menu is always changing which guarantees a unique experience with each visit!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2},

The venue itself is very unique and homey, with a somewhat artsy feel. Although they do not have an extremely large selection of beers on tap, they have a rather extensive list of bottled and canned beers.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had been to other Paint Studios before, but they always lacked the personality one would expect from an art studio. When we first walked in, we were immediately aided in picking out a canvas, paint colors, and a place to sit. Our waitress was extremely patient and made sure that we had all the painting supplies and drinks that we needed. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that Friday is Open Mic Night. Rather than sitting listening to normal coffee house music, it was nice to have a variety of local artists serenade us as we painted.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The dance floor is located downstairs and tends to get extremely muggy as the night goes on. I would definitely recommend Sotto if you are looking for a fun place to let loose and have fun. Just be sure to bring cash because they sometimes have a cover at the door.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We arrived with a fairly large group and were seated immediately. Unfortunately, the food ended up taking almost an hour to come out after we ordered. The Mac and Cheese was pretty delicious, but the barbecue was quite dry. Overall, Red Rock seems like a great place to grab a casual drink, but I would definitely recommend grabbing dinner somewhere else!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Monthly memberships are a little expensive, but I would definitely recommend at least trying a class or two!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
