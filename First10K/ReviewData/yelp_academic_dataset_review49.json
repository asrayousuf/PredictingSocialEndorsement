I typically do not write reviews but in this case I did read them.  I booked Haul N Ass for my Sister's May Wedding in Cottonwood after coming across photos from a friends IG.  The post was tagged and I called the number and although it was somewhat last minute (i would have booked it sooner if i had known about it) vanessa took the time to answer all of my questions and since they had been to the venue before the booking was fairly straight forward.  The only rub was that they only accepted payment in full in advance of the date and I was more than a little nervous since it was not a small amount of money.  So before I mailed the check out of curiosity I went online and attempted to do some research on the company and this is when I cam across the yelp review.  I read the long crazy rant from jennifer (what a bridezilla) and I also read the stupid post from Lizz T.  Yep I had some time on my hands. And I have to say the negative post was strange to me since it didn't add up to my experience that i had with Haul N Ass to that point.  Well I sent the check and hoped for the best after all it was a surprise so if they didn't show up at least no one besides me would be dissapointed.  Well the day came and they did exactly what they said they would do.  It was like they appeared out of nowhere and after the ceremony the donkey was the first thing everyone came to.  The donkey was awesome! I mean it looked like something out of a magazine and my Sister went crazy.  She wanted the burro to begin with but they just didn't have the money left over in their budget.  So back to reason I am writing this.  That POS post by Lizz T actually caused me to second guess my decision to get the donkey.  The photos came back from the photographer today which made me remember and Lizz T bullshit post and I felt the need to write this because having the donkey at my Sister's wedding was amazing and we almost missed out because of what I will call politely misinformation and what is clearly an agenda by Lizz T - yelp should not allow her to posts - that all.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

All the complaints about the wait time to check in, the parking fess, resort fees etc. However, to me, resort and parking fees were not a big deal since most places have such fees. \n\nI requested early check-in which was an additional $35 and I must say so worth it!!! We arrived Saturday morning, check in took less than 5 minutes. No line, no hassle from the receptionist. When we went down to the lobby later on during the day, the line to check in was ridiculous. So I was beyond glad I had requested early check in.  They gave me a beautiful room on the 28th floor. The room was really nice and spacious. The beds were comfy, pillows, beautiful vanity mirrors. Our bags were delivered to our room in a decent amount of time. So far so good!\n\nWe checked out Daylight which was fun!!! The bar was super packed. I must give the bartenders a pat on their backs for taking care of everyone. Both girls that helped us were super chill and nice. I would of died if I worked there. So kudos to them! Not an easy job to do. \n\nThe only thing I must say was a bit absurd was that our last night there we got a noise complaint. Three security guards knocked on the door stating there had been a complaint about us being too loud. Mind you all we were doing that night was watching TV and talking amongst ourselves. We didn't have any music playing. So we asked the guard what do you recommend we do as we are just hanging out. They said \"maybe talk a bit lower.\" LOL Not to mention it was only 930ish at night. It felt as though the people next door were too sensitive. It's Vegas. What do you expect for people to sleep before 10. Hmm. \n\nMoving on to the pools. The wave pool and lazy river= AWESOME. I did get stuck under the waterfall at the lazy river which was pretty hilarious. I couldn't get my tube to move away from the waterfall.  My friends just laughed at me. Kinda bummed we didn't get a chance to check out all the other pools since we did other things. \n\nWe went to Border Grill for dinner. The food is delicious.

My family & I had eaten here at least 5 times before, never with a problem. When we went yesterday, they were understaffed with 2 polite & apologetic employees. We were very understanding & patient as we waited for our food & we had no problems with the 2 employees, who were very pleasant. \nOur food took a little long, but we were fine with that as the staff was apologetic & we sympathized with them. Unfortunately, the Orange Chicken had no chicken inside of it and tasted like a ball of dough...it was disgusting. The Kung Po chicken tasted ok, but it was completly different from when we've ordered it in the past at this restaurant.\nThen Kenny (the owner) came over to our table, asked what the problem was, picked up a half eaten piece of Orange \"Chicken\" from my 10 year old daughter's plate, popped it in his mouth and said, \"This is chicken!\" as food sprayed from his mouth. He did the same with the Kung Po Chicken, argued for a minute, then said, \" you know what, you're right, my new chef sucks & his food tastes like shit!\" \nThe whole thing spiraled out of control...he seemed like he might've been drunk. He started to say he was going to fire his chef, he got louder & louder, & said he was going to do us a favor and not charge us. I explained that we didn't want his food, didn't want to come back, and he wasn't doing us a favor by not charging for food we weren't going to eat. Food that, in his own words, \"tasted like shit.\" I also said he should refund us the $17 we spent on the Groupon for his restaurant. Then he got belligerent...he was swearing (shit this & fuck that) in front of my kids (6, 8, & 10) and other customers could not believe what was going on. My wife helped keep me relatively calm as we escorted our children out while he continued to yell profanities at us & recommended we eat at McDonald's. He also made some comment about coming into his restaurant with a groupon - that we shouldn't expect so much when we're not paying full price. \nI can not believe what an aweful experience this was and, while I feel pity for Kenny & the pathetic life he must be living, I feel more sorry for his friendly employees who deserve to work somewhere better and for my children who were terrified & in tears.","useful":12,"funny":4,"cool":2},

Having never had duck, I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nI had the grilled chicken with bacon Mac n' cheese and subbed the kale for carrots. The meal arrived and it was a very generous portion.

The jam was sweet and not at all spicy, and it paired very nicely with the marinated chicken breasts, which were juicy and flavorful. The mac'n cheese was creamy, comforting, and yet completely different from your typical Mac.  Plus, they did not scrimp on the bacon. Against my own better judgement, I finished every bite. The carrots and root vegetable were slightly undercooked, but the flavors were on point, and I actually didn't mind the texture. \n\nOther friends got the scallops, the 16oz  steak, the Philly cheese steak, and the bolognese.

I love a good burger, and with the wide array of options shown on Streat Burger's menu, I was pretty confident that I'd walk out happy.\n\nThis wasn't the case, unfortunately.\n\nI have no complaints about the service. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating, but the food was another story.\n\nI ordered a Brokeback burger with the BBB (that's their burger and bacon blend patty) and my wife had a plainsville turkey burger. We ordered the fried pickle chips and fried cheese curds as an appetizer. \n\nIt took longer than expected for the apps to come out, but the server acknowledged this saying that the pickle chips had to be made twice, and she apologized. It didn't bother me much, as I was happy sipping on a Portside vanilla stout (they have a pretty good beer list).\n\nWhen we did get the appetizers, the first thing I noticed was that the \"cheese curds\" were the size of mozzarella sticks. I can only begin to imagine what an abomination their poutine is if that's what they serve with it. Also, the \"marinara\" sauce that came with the \"cheese curds\" was more of a paste than a sauce. We ended up using the sauce that came with the pickle chips instead, which was significantly better. \n\nThe pickle chips themselves, however, were probably some of the worst I've had. It was mostly dough with very thin pickle chips. I barely got any of the briney, pickley flavor, but I got plenty of greasy doughy flavor.\n\nThe burgers, the reason this place should be known and loved, were probably the most disappointing aspect of the meal. My burger was flavorful enough, but that was mainly because of all the toppings. In fact, that's all I could taste as the BBB was very thin and dry. There was no juiciness, thickness, or beefiness to be found in this anemic patty. What a shame.\n\nI didn't try the turkey burger my wife had, but she said that it was mushy. Our side of fries were nothing to write home about either. The weren't crisp and were slightly under-done.\n\nI really hope this place shapes up, because right now, there are much better options out there in the Cleveland area vying for a burger lover's attention (B-Spot, Flip Side, Dynomite). Streat Burgers should visit these places and take some notes, paying close attention to the burger patty.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I asked her why then, during my first call, did someone tell me the order was on the way. She had no explanation and claimed that I must've called another store - I didn't, I called the same number. It was also her assertion that I probably ordered from a different store, but would do me the favor of checking their computer to verify this. She said she would call me back in 15 minutes.\n\nFifteen minutes later, she called back and confirmed that the order was indeed in their system and I finally received an apology.

I asked her if I was getting a refund and she told me that I wouldn't get the pizza if she gave me a refund.\n\nSince I wasn't about to pay full price to get a pizza delivered in three hours, I told her to forget it and take the charge off my card.\n\nLast time we order from there.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The balsamic onions did their job perfectly by providing a nice touch of sweet and sour to prevent the burger from being over-rich. The tomato mayo was delicious too, although a good amount of it escaped onto my hands and the burger wrapper below. I must have went through a trees-worth of napkins. This burger was MESS-Y!\n\nThe side of fries, while certainly not the best fries I've ever had, were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. No complaints there.\n\nIn fact, I have no complaints at all. Although if there HAD to be any gripe it would be that it can be pretty chilly in the winter, standing outside waiting for your burger order to be completed, but that can be avoided by calling ahead.

Drs. Miller and Novak were particularly competent and did an outstanding job of diagnosing, performing surgery and following up.  They also kept my regular ophthalmologist informed of my progress and coordinated care to minimize duplication.  The convenience of the Mentor, OH location made my experience all the better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I took my car in with coupons for the $19.99 oil change and $89.99 complete brake service.  The attendant explained that the oil change coupon was only good for cars more than five years old since 2011+ model years required synthetic oil.  He informed me that my oil change would be $60.00.  The complete brake service?.......$290.00.  I left my freshly washed and garaged car with them so they could do the work.  They left it out in the rain so by the time the work was complete my car was filthy and covered in muddy residue.  $30.00 car wash completed my expensive experience with Brake Masters.  I am not sure if I am more upset by the false advertising, sticker shock careless custody of my car.   Stay away.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I can't believe we waited for 45 minutes to down a $15.00 cheeseburger.  By the way, the cookie bell at the front door is a \"hot zone\".   Stay away from it.  We witnessed a never ending grab of grubby fingers instead of use of the provided serving utensil.   Nice try Chelsea's but not worth the wait.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Friday night after a long work week we were looking forward to trying the new restaurant in our neighborhood in north Scottsdale,  We were seated immediately and our waitress introduced herself moments later.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of guacamole and chips.  The house chardonnay was exceptional but the beer was warm.  The guacamole was so spicy it left blisters in our mouths.  We waited nearly a half an hour for our waitress to return to take our order before we gave up and left.  Our bill for uneaten guacamole, a warm unfinished beer and a most enjoyable glass of wine was more than $20.00.  Lastly, although I don't think that north Scottsdale Los Sombreros will be in business 10 months from now, the staff should be advised that fragrances are a \"no no\".   Chanel's signature fragrance should be saved for \"date night\" since diners would rather smell their food if they could get an order in.  North Scottsdale has many excellent Mexican restaurants.  Los Sombreros is not one of them.  Skip this one.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1},

The clam chowder was good as was the spinach salad. The crab cakes were good but the sauce was not. tasted like straight horseradish. My husband had scallops-just ok and I had the coconut shrimp-ok. Our rice was so undercooked that it was crunchy and uneatable. We won't be back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
