Bagels were a staple in our home.  So finding Montreal style bagels was something important to me when I moved here.  In all honesty?  I think these may be a little better than the originals.  Make sure you buy them first thing in the morning when they come out hot.  Although they are great on their own, I love to toast them butter them and then coat with Philadelphia whipped cream cheese.  YUM!\n\nI find it interesting how people comment on the quaintness of the store as if it should be more than it is.  The true bagel shops of Montreal are just as simple. \n\nPS... this is a Cash only place","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

We had the Jatoba salad with lobster pieces, spice-crusted beef carpaccio, a variety of sashimi from Albacore to Blue fin, another course of every type of dumplings, gigantic pieces of succulent shrimp tempura, seared scallops in browned butter, ginger lobster with grilled gai lan, and my coworkers even had the beef with grilled foie gras, while I opted for the buttery grilled king oyster mushrooms.  \n\nEach dish was a marriage of fresh and interesting flavour profiles, with classic additions such as grilled shishito pepper and pickled daikon to dwarf peaches and cucumber mixed with the lovely texture of roe and the melt-in-your-mouth fish. Delicate flavours were preserved, yet paired with bold tastes which would please even the most discerning of palates.\n\nEven the desserts were exquisite; although none of the eight of us has a particularly sweet tooth, we couldn't turn away the last course, which was plates of the mango curd tart with meringue brulÃ© and green apple sorbet and a great take on the humble but delectable pouding chomeur topped with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberries. \n\nIn all of my experience dining out, I can easily say this was one of the top three meals I've ever had.

Service was attentive without being overbearing and our server gladly offered wine pairings to each course. \n\nI had lovely grilled summer vegetables as an antipasto, which they removed the anchovy vinaigrette from at my request. It was topped off with crunchy, breakcrumbs, which were slightly salty for my taste. Opting to skip the primo, I went straight for a secondo of creamy courgette and pine nut risotto (vegan!) topped with rich, buttery wild mushroom. The second offering was delicious, perfectly balanced, and filling. For dessert, the server thoughtfully mentioned that the chocolate mousse with candied oranges and cookie-like crunchies was a vegan-friendly option. The taste of the orange was strong, but incredibly earthy and natural, while the texture of the mousse was velvety and decadent. Overall, the quality of the food was impeccable. \n\nMy only issue with my experience is that I found it to be somewhat pricey for the portion size, a problem that was consistent through each course.

Fresh produce and inventive use of veggies (plus a chia seed there or a nut here) are more than enough to create an appetizing vegan meal. My veggie burger and fries were extremely, extremely heavy. The fries were more like soft slabs of potato than crispy French fries.\n\nMy two friends split a bowl (Dragon, I believe) and a BLT.

There is also a restaurant called La Cave at the Paris hotel. Different restaurant, a bit confusing.\n\nBack to business, La Cave at the Wynn Hotel. This is a tapas restaurant. You order a bunch of small plates and share. Everything we ordered (and we ordered a lot) was delicious. There were 5 of us and we probably ordered about 15 different small plates. Also had wine. There was also a vegan in our party, and she ordered 3 different menu items off the vegan menu (you have to ask for it but every single restaurant in the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu if you ask.)\n\nMy favorite item was the flatbread with artichokes and ricotta cheese on top. It was amazing. I don't eat meat, but the guys in our party loved the mini burgers. They wound up ordering an additional serving of those. Cheeses were phenomenal. Had to ask for more little breads to go with the brie. My sister the vegan ordered another version of the artichoke flatbread (sans cheese) which she said was phenomenal as well. She also had a beet dish that she said was very good.\n\nJust a couple negatives. First of all, I called this restaurant a couple weeks before our trip to make reservations. I was told that since La Cave was one of the more \"casual dining options\" at the Wynn, they did not take reservations. Upon arriving at La Cave on the night of my 40th birthday, I was asked if we had a reservation. I told the hostess that i had called and was told i could not make a reservation. She said i must have spoken to the wrong person. She proceeded to tell me that their tables were all booked up for the night, but that she could make room for us in the lounge area. This turned out fine. I actually liked the lounge area better than the main restaurant area. A lot more light out there in the enclosed patio area. (Outdoor patio was closed due to high winds....although we saw people sitting out there even after we were told it was closed.) The only problem with the lounge area was that the tables were low and the seating is not really set up for a meal. But it worked out fine since it was a small plates\/casual eating situation. I was just disappointed that when i called the phone number listed for the restaurant online, i was told one thing, then was told something different on arrival. I am so glad they had room for us since this was a birthday trip planned months in advance, and i picked La Cave out of all the other restaurants in Vegas due to their menu options that worked for everyone in the birthday party. We dropped about $1,000 at this place, and they almost lost our business. I would say they need to fix this issue asap.\n\nOne other caveat: this place is very expensive. It may be one of the more \"casual\" dining options at the Wynn, but not when it comes to the price. Since it is a small plates\/tapas style restaurant, you have to order at least 2 plates per person to have enough food (that's why they're called \"small plates.\") Each plate is around $12-$20. And then there's the beverages. A glass of wine will cost you about $15. The cheapest bottle is around $65.\n\nAlso, i have to say that I wish there were some restaurants in Vegas where all the servers\/waitresses\/hostesses were not dressed like prostitutes. No matter where we ate throughout our stay, no matter how upscale the restaurant, without fail, all the waitresses were wearing skin tight stretchy dresses\/skirts that just barely covered their private parts. Since it was my first trip to Vegas, this caught me a bit off guard. But i guess that's just Vegas. This is definitely a town set up for men. I noticed that male servers were not dressed similarly\/scantily. Just the females (and most of the servers were female in all the restaurants.)","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Best NY style pizza i have had outside of the real NY. And I'm a New Yorker.\n\nFirst time we went was our first night in Vegas. Trying to grab a quick bite after seeing a show. We ate outside on the patio and ate our slices next to the pretty waterfalls late at night. Very nice.\n\nSecond time we came in for lunch with a larger group. Very busy, long line. \n\nThey also have a vegan menu here (you have to ask for it, but every restaurant at the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu). My sister, the vegan, had a vegan sandwich (veggies on vegan bread) which she said was awesome.\n\nHere comes the bad news for vegans. This is a order-at-the-counter then go sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you place. The lady behind the counter who took our order was an english as a second language person. We told her repeatedly that my sister was vegan and everything she was ordering needed to be vegan. We pointed at the vegan menu several times. She still kept asking every time we ordered something, do you want that with cheese? Do you want the vegan one? YES, WE WANT THE VEGAN ONE we said, LOUDLY while pointing at the vegan menu. O.k., so at the end, we thought we had properly communicated that we needed all vegan food for my sister. On the vegan menu were vegan garlic fries, which we ordered. We made it CRYSTAL CLEAR we needed the VEGAN garlic fries, not the regular ones. Seriously, we said it SEVERAL times. Well, my sister gets her sandwich and fries and starts to eat. I say, what's that stuff on top of your fries? She said she thought it was big chunks of garlic. Then she takes a closer look and realizes it's cheese. We go to the counter and complain. The manager comes out. They replace the fries with vegan ones, but the manager seems to be blaming my sister for not ordering the right fries. Are you kidding me? We could not possibly have been any clearer. Seriously, this is a very big deal to vegans. No apology, no offer of compensation, nothing. Very disappointed in how that was handled.\n\nHere's some advice for Mr. Wynn. If you want vegans to eat at your restaurants, you need to ensure that the staff at all your restaurants understand the vegan issue, and that they speak english fluently. This was unacceptable.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Dining companions had waffles with chocolate chunks and whip cream and berries on top. Delicious fun. Dessert for breakfast!\n\nWhen we came for our late night dessert we sat in the chocolate lounge area which is very cool. Had a huge cupcake. Dining companions had chocolate sundae and cheesecake. And we had some wine.\n\nThe only negative i would say is that just like everywhere else in Vegas, the hostesses\/servers dress like prostitutes. The skin tight stretchy dresses\/skirts that barely cover their private parts. Can i have my breakfast without looking at your hooha s'il vous plaÃ®t? This town is definitely a man's town.

It is off the strip, which made it hard to choose over the many spa options on the strip, but it had a pedicure option that sounded so divine, it made it worth the trip. I am so glad i did! You definitely need a car to get here.\n\nMy sister and I (along with our husbands and father) spent several hours here one day. The men hung out on the men's side of the spa, and we on the women's side. We went a couple hours early before our pedicure appointment so that we could enjoy the spa amenities before hand. So glad we did. You have to go early to do the \"aqua sulis rituals\" (i.e. the hot and cold pools) as well as the steam room. I love a good steam! Our spa service (pedicures) came with full access to the spa for the day. The men didn't have services done, so they had to pay a $25 fee for use of the spa for the day. My dad, who goes to vegas frequently, said he will definitely be back to enjoy the spa experience again.\n\nIt was disappointing that the outside spa pool was not in service on the day we went. It would have been nice to have been told this when we made the appointment and\/or when they called us to confirm the appointment the day before hand. Although that was disappointing, we thoroughly enjoyed our time there.\n\nThere is also a huge pool area (outside of the spa, the regular hotel pool) which is beautiful. There is also a poolside cafe where you can have a bite to eat. That pool was totally open while we were there.\n\nPedicures were amazing. We got the wine down pedicures which come with 2 glasses of wine each and a huge plate of several different cheeses as well as some crackers. Very generous portions of cheese, very good cheese, very generous and good wine. It was Ravenswood Zinfandel, one of my favorites! There was brie, cheddar, gouda... there was also a bit of fruit.\n\nThe ladies who gave us our pedicures did an excellent job. Every time i look at my pretty toes i smile remembering the great time we had! They took their time and were very professional and thorough with each part of the pedicure experience.\n\nThe chairs that you sit in during the pedicure are awesome. So comfortable. And the foot bath you put your feet in is amazing. The products used on your feet are so wonderful. Everything was perfect, relaxing, luxurious. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.\n\nThe only thing I think that could be improved would be a walk through of the spa area explaining the aqua sulis rituals. We were only shown to the locker room and assigned lockers. We pretty much had to figure everything out on our own. If you are advertising this as a \"ritual\" then you should explain what that ritual entails. Or if you don't want to pay someone to explain that, then at least have a sign up that explains it.\n\nThis was my first trip to Vegas. I really didn't care for Vegas very much and really don't have a desire to go back (i don't gamble, and hate cigarette smoke) but i have to say that the side trip to the spa was the best part of my trip, and i would LOVE to go back just to stay at this place and do spa days every day! I'm thinking i will have to plan a girl's trip just to hang out at this spa again. The entry way to the hotel looked amazing too. I'd love to go back and stay there and check it out.\n\nThe men also had a great time on the guys' side of the spa. The only negative is if you wanted to have a couples experience at a spa, this is not the right spa to do that in. The only shared co-ed area of the spa is the outdoor area pool and the gym.\n\nThis place is wonderful and absolutely 100% definitely worth the trip off the strip. Do it - you won't regret it! My free advice - go WAY early before your appointment to give yourself PLENTY of time to enjoy the spa! Make a day of it! Even if you are only having one service done!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

It was a beautiful, warm summer night so we requested to be seated on the patio. The owner said it was \"too windy\" and \"going to rain\" (neither of which were true) and instead, allowed his staff to drink and smoke on the patio. Putting your needs before that of your customers is always a bad business decision. \n\nWe had 2 or 3 different waiters who were intrusive, hovering around and clearing each plate the second we put our forks down.

So it is with great disappointment and sadness that I write this review.\n\nSweet Lulu has always been a Queen West staple and I have many fond memories of date nights and lazy day deliveries. The concept is perfect and the meal has all the elements one could possibly want in a dish - noodles, protein, veggies, garnish and sauce, all customized to your liking.\n\nMy beef (no pun intended) began when both my husband and I started noticing tummy troubles after consuming the main dish. At first, I tried to brush it off as something else we had eaten that day, but it started happening more frequently. Before, just one of us or the other... but now, both of us.\n\nI'm not sure what's causing this issue or if some wacky ingredient has been thrown into the mix but unfortunately now, you're just somebody that I used to know.\n\nNOTE: The extra star is for the friendly phone service and awesome delivery dude.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

After making a truck booking online for a move to a new apartment, I received an email a couple of days later stating an entirely different pickup time and location. Baffled, I called their customer service and was treated to the attitude of a smug and highly defensive female who refused to let me speak. I called back numerous times before finally being transferred to the Manger so that I could complain to someone with a slight grasp of customer service.\n\nIf your website makes you do the rounds to search for an available truck then asks you for a credit card to hold the reservation, I would expect the date and time to be set in stone. Well, with U-Haul it ain't. They can change it whenever the hell the feel like it if they rent their vehicles to someone else... even though you have expertly coordinated your pickup time\/location to coincide with your apartment elevator booking time.\n\nThe only reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is because we drove across Canada with a U-Haul trailer attached to our truck and arrived with all of our belongings in check.\n\nA moving company with a useless website that doesn't understand the coordination and timing involved in a move, while also contributing to your already high stress levels, is not a company that I want helping me move.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

So if you're planning on staying here and plan on using the pool with the complimentary lounge chairs, I would suggest getting there at 9:00am when they open to put a towel with a book, shirt, sandals, etc.... to hold a lounge chair if you don't plan sitting there at that time so then you should be guaranteed a lounge chair when you decide to stay later.

I have been in places where both she and i had been discriminated against and it is hurtful. I will say when i came in here today, i was immediately greeted by Jasmin (?) I hope I got her name right. She was so helpful and took our orders right away. I had a restaurant.com certificate and i wanted chicken and waffles (my daughter loves Roscoe's in Pasadena and I wanted her to have them here). Jasmin suggested we get the chicken and waffles and in order to utilize the value of the certificate she recommended the smothered chicken as a to-go order. The food was brought out fresh, hot and delicious. No attitude by anyone that I was aware of, if anything, they were uber attentive. She even got us our drinks to go. Nice touch. All the food (and there was a LOT) was so delicious. I will definitely be coming back more often. everyone has an \"off\" day and poor service and rudeness are inexcusable, but I am happy to say that M&M treated me and my daughter like family. I can't wait to try the chitterlings next time..","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Ended up getting spaghetti Bologna's and a chicken parmesan sandwich as well as a loaf of fresh italian bread and an antipasti salad.  The prices actually seemed to go down (at least stay the same) as they were in the last 2 years.  The food and service are still excellent and you can really taste the quality that using primo ingredients and passion that chef Marc uses in his food.  It is superior to every other italian food I have tried from some so-called \"italian\" restaurants.  The portions are huge, and while it isn't cheap, you get what you pay for and the deli prices are no more than what you pay at the grocery store for deli meats and cheeses as well as bread.

They are excellent. I bumped up to 5 because the service was so friendly and the food really was worthy of 5 stars. My only MINOR sadness was no cilantro for my menudo (I forgot to ask and should have-can't fault them). I ordered the barbacoa taco (beef cheek) EXCELLENT--flavorful with onions, cilantro and a squeeze of lime to cut the richness. No skimping on the meat here, either! The menudo is some of the best I've had. No \"gamey\" flavor. Rich, flavor broth, tender tripe,  Mexican oregano (I have never seen that offered on the side before!) and the bread--the aroma wafted from the bag and was intoxicating!! I wish I had asked for cilantro and some cabbage, but again..my fault. And the \"piece de resistance\" NACHOS I deviated from the usual carne asada and got the shredded beef because it just sounded good. These are better than \"Bob's\" on SOOOO many levels!!  1: The chips - Fresher, not greasy, better flavor and enough salt. (and more of them). 2. The beans Not a glob of refried beans! Actual pinto beans and delicious at that! 3. The beef Tons of it, tender, flavorful, delicious. 4 excellent pico de gallo. 5. fresh guacamole evenly dispersed 5.what tastes like mexican crema again, even dispersed across the nachos. 6 Finally, and this is a biggie for me COTIJA cheese, not cheddar. Cheddar is greasy--cotija is not. It is a white tasty cheese. Their salsas are also really good they have a red and green, neither overly spicy, but flavorful. I am sure they have some hot stuff, and I can't wait to return to try more, just didn't want to seem a pig my first visit :)","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2},

I love grilling my own food to my doneness and the sauces were great. I took home a lot of leftovers and even had pineapple sorbetto for dessert, Very delicious. For the quantity and quality of food this place is really awesome. It was a little quiet when we went, but we were there right when they opened on a Thursday evening. Personally, I like that.

The guys that work there were really helpful, and being able to order by the inch as opposed to by the slice or a whole pizza allows you to try more than 1 type (Perfect for those of us who are indecisive) and people who can't power down a whole pie.  They also have a huge gelato selection (I recommend the butter pecan!) and cappuccino. It is hidden in there by Powder and Sun and Massage Nirvana (by Peace\/Ft Apache).

One step inside the front doors of this place and you know it's going to be a wonderful stay. All I have to say is you get what you pay for. \n\nResort has absolutely stunning grounds and 10 pools! How can you not love that. Very nice Adult only pool with bar and grotto. \n\nThe other pools with kids were still very nice and I found all of the kids to be well behaved. There were not tons of them as this is mostly an adult place anyway. \n\nDid I mention the grounds were stunning...we paid for a room with a garden view and it was worth it. I just loved sitting on our balcony taking in the view. Only weird part is that you share a balcony with the room next door which I did not like and proved to be a problem later on. \n\nAte at SWB, food was good, prices were in line with resort fare I guess. Enjoyed the martinis at Cafe Due. Didn't have a chance to try Alto, though I hear it's out of this world. \n\nLive music was wonderful, I really enjoyed the Falmenco on Saturday night. \n\nStaff was always very polite, although poolside service is incredibly slow and the drinks are not that strong. For $9 solo cup pina colada I'd like a little rum please....I'm just saying. \n\nBack to the balcony issue. Our neighbors decide to have a large get together with their patio door open....this meant I could hear everything...I'd had fantasies about smothering the loud cackling woman who was keeping me awake with a pillow. By 1:15 am I had had enough and had to call the front desk. \n\nThey said they had a \"no tolerance\" policy and would send security up. 30 minutes later no relief and no security in sight...I think I just finally passed out. \n\nThe only other downside were the beds. Very uncomfortable and had a spring in my back all night. For the life of me I don't understand why hotels have to be this way. You pay a high price, you offer 5-star dining, you have the word \"resort\" in your name..lets find a way to put in comfortable matresses....mkay? \n\nWould have given them 5-stars if not for the issues listed above.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I placed an order online which Best Buy gladly collected money for (visible charge on PayPal). I received an email stating if the item is in stock my order could be ready to pick-up in as a little as 45 minutes. 90 minutes later no confirmation.\n\nUpon calling the store I was notified the see my order but it can't be picked up. The item was in stock but hadn't processed. What's the barrier to get that to happen? No one in the store could say. One employee did try to call their help desk. Another I spoke with lied and said they had no help desk. The apparent solution? Cancel my online order (leaving a pending charge until it drops off of course) and just buy the item in store. No-one could logically explain how that's easier than giving me the item I already, ya know, bought.\n\nThe online support team seemed mildly more helpful. Supposedly sending out emails to push the order (though in store upon pickup I was told the online rep didn't actually do anything but rather just waited for the order to progress). Three hours later the order finally goes through. This wouldn't be all together bad if the website and emails sent by Best Buy don't trumpet a 45 turn around. Even the hold music breaks say how easy doing store pick-up should be. So why isn't it? And why give a turn around time well below the actual time?\n\nGetting a hold of higher up managers to ask this question is apparently difficult also. I asked to speak to a GM but they couldn't guarantee I'd be able to. I was also told speaking with the district manager would be unlikely. Corporate contact? Definitely not. \n\nIn short. This is why Amazon exists and why it will hopefully one day replace Best Buy completely. Immediacy is the only reason to go into brick and mortar like Best Buy. Store pick-up is an attempt to provide the immediacy of going into a store with the simplicity of online shopping. Bottom line. Best Buy does not deliver on it's promise of this.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My husband, son and I got there in no time. Twenty bucks for all of us to get in seemed pretty reasonable, and we thought we would use the ten dollar voucher for the restaurant that you get upon entry.\n\nI know lots of people have given this place positive reviews across the internet, but there are some down sides to Bonnie Springs. My husband and I took our one year old to see the petting zoo, and we tried to take the stroller in, but it was VERY hard to maneuver over the gravel that was in the old west town. There are numerous wooden stairs everywhere as well. If you are in a wheelchair, be warned, this is a very non-handicapped-accessible location. I wouldn't bother.\n\nThey don't have many signs telling you exactly where the petting zoo is. You kind of have to wander around until you find the actual \"petting\" part. In actuality, there are very few animals loose to pet. At least when we went there was one goat, and a few very sleepy deer that were tolerant. The rest of the animals were behind cages (for safety sake, of course). All the animals seemed fairly well taken care of. There were a few cases where I question the animal's health, but nothing drastic.\n\nWe cut our losses and didn't try the restaurant. Since it's so close to Vegas, it was more appetizing to go back into town and grab something there. We didn't make the effort to see any of the wild west performances, either. It was hot and baby was tired.\n\nI would say that overall we had a good time. I'm glad we gave the place a chance and checked it out. The animals did make my son smile, and there was a lot to look at, but I can't see going back any time soon.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

The interior was a tad small, but my date and I had no problem being seating within 30 seconds.  My only issue was the tables were not spaced far enough, or they had too many tables.

I chose from the vino rosso, since i only drink reds.  I picked the Australian Tik Tok Merlot - a nice full bodied red that went well with our meal... veal.\n\nWe decided to skip the antipasti and go straight to the main - I had the VITELLO ALLA NIZZARDA and my date had the VITELLO PARMIAGANA.\nMy meal was very tasty!  3 veal scaloppini's in a red wine sauce, with a nice medley of veggies on the side along with roasted potato's.
