First encounter with a salesman was positive. I was replacing a 25 yo bike due to discomfort on long tours, and didn't want to pay for things that I didn't need. He listened well and narrowed the choices, and suggested that I start with a fitting to ensure best comfort. I did have my old bike fitted (prepurchase fitting), even though I thought it expensive (a second fitting would also be needed for the new bike for seat mapping, etc). The appointment started 30 min late, and a second salesman was a bit awkward with me in the store, but the fitting was thorough, and the tech spent a lot of time making sure that it was exactly right. This did not help me with selection- she directed me to a website - but I figured I would come back and talk to the original salesman. The change of my old bike did make a huge difference. I was able to extend my range the following day and was much more comfortable...until I had a minor crash when my handle bars came loose. Turns out all the changed settings were not tightened down completely (protective caps were also left off). Luckily we were in the last 2-1\/2 miles of a 40 mile ride so the walk back was only a mild annoyance - some responsibility is mine for not checking the bike first. My husband was much more frustrated about the lack of attention to detail and vowed never to return.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I currently live in Ohio and there are NO salons here that offer it, so on one of my Vegas trips I looked up Marshall on Yelp.  I was concerned because I'm caucasian and was worried my hair wouldn't take the perm.  My stylist assured me it'd be alright, that they knew how to handle it.  And they did!  I saw Jong Seok Won and will go back to him every 6 months to re-up!  It's worth a trip to Vegas to get this beautiful perm.  I've gotten SO many compliments on my hair ever since I got it done, and Jong showed me all the different ways to style it.  I also greatly appreciated Jong's patience with me, as there was a bit of a language barrier, and he was patient and worked wonderfully with me, and was the kindest of men.  Can't wait to get it done again!\nThe perm took about 2 1\/2 hours (which I liked because the salons in LA and SoCal said the digital perm would take 4 hours!!!) and I was comfortable and the process was smooth and easy.  The price was wonderful also,  the quote I was given was $200 for the perm (I have very long hair) and that came also with a cut before the perm and also styling (and styling lessons) after.

I tried other places here, but no other coffee places could match Dutch Bros, their drinks and the consistent warm welcome we always received.

Maybe it was the employees wonderful attitudes that helped it be so good...so uplifting. .and such a daily treat and pick me up. One day we were riding and I spotted a Ditch Bros.

I miss Oregon, the rainy days and my family, but having Dutch Bros here gave me a little bit of home and I mean that seriously. Not only that, but now they built a new one, right down the street from me...not even a mile.  It makes a nice walk.

I feel moved to write a review for CKBR, especially because I see some negative reviews. I have so much respect for this company. They completed a kitchen and bathroom remodel for us. My husband worked as a project manager for much of his career in residential remodel. With this being said, we had high expectations but also realistic expectations. I think it is very important to have realistic expectations when endeavoring on a home remodel project and I think some of the bad reviews on here stem from people who had\/have unrealistic expectations. When you are doing a remodel, your home turns into a construction zone. A delay is enough to make you want to pull your hair out and scream at somebody. You want nothing more than to have your home back in a timely manner. We are all human and probably would all feel similarly in this situation. But the reality is, in the construction industry - delays happen, ALL THE TIME. My husband says, \"it's not IF there will be a delay, it's what the delay will be\". If you are not prepared to deal with a delay or a hiccup along the way, then you should probably not get your home remodeled. I do not say that to be snarky, I say that to save you your sanity.\n\nFor our project, we had two delays. We had a delay regarding countertops and then another delay that was actually caused by us. We changed our mind on the deco tile we selected. CKBR began the installation of our deco tile in our bathroom and I did not like how it looked. I chose the tile myself and it wasn't until I saw it go up in the bathroom that I decided it wasn't what I wanted. Don and Ray were beyond accommodating and arranged to have the interior designer make a home visit with samples to reselect my deco tile. They didn't charge me for this (even though I gladly would have paid). The designer came out and I selected a new tile that I LOVED. We completed a change order for the cost of the new tile and I paid it on the spot. They did not charge me for the extra labor to tear out what they had done which was nice. I then got a phone call a few days later from the designer who let me know they had a bunch of the deco tile I selected in stock from something they mis-ordered months ago. She informed me that since they already had the tile in stock and paid for - it wouldn't be as expensive as expensive as the change order I paid for. They ended up putting a credit on my account for the difference. That blew me away because I would have never know this if they were not forthcoming and they could have EASILY kept the additional money. I gained a lot of trust for them from that. Fast forward to the completion of the project, my kitchen and bathroom were completed and looked amazing. About a week after the job was done, I noticed there was some sealing that was missed on an area on the kitchen countertop. I called the office to let them know and within 3 days they had a guy out there to fix it. Everyone I dealt with was extremely pleasant and they just left a great taste in my mouth. Since then, I have recommended them to several people, one of whom (my neighbor) has actually hired them to do her kitchen. The project is currently in process and she is pleased with them as well.Â \n\nI wanted to show you guys some love and give you a good review because you deserve it. I will continue recommending you to all my friends and family.","useful":3,"funny":5,"cool":0},

The food was alright - ate from the pre fixe menu and it was normal 'fancy food' salmon, small salads, chocolate cakes, etc. The worst part was that near our side of the restaurant, we happened to have a great view as the sun was disappearing, so lots of other people crowded around our table to take pictures of the sunset against the glass - rude.

They also had a promo going on - a game of 'around the world' ping pong that anyone could play for free - so that was nice to get a little more bang for your buck while there.

I really liked them at their old location. The new location is really nice. A lot nicer than the old, to be sure, but the food? Eh. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday and took advantage of the cheap tacos. They just bring the shells and meat to you and then you finish them off at the taco bar. They had the normal taco fare. Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, different salsas and hot sauces, and (unfortunately) pickled jalapeÃ±os. I wish they had fresh jalapeÃ±os but whatever. All of the fixings were fresh. \n\nI got the beef tacos. Big mistake. The beef had the texture (and I assume the taste) of Moon Sand. If you have kids you know what I mean. It was so bland that it could have been served in a nursing home. The texture made me think that whatever meat they used was put into a blender and someone hit purÃ©e but then started playing Angry Birds and forgot about it. \n\nService was great.

The waitress came by to pick up the bill and when she saw the tip amount she told me \"This is how much 15% tip would be.\"  I told her I'm giving you 10% because that's what I believe you deserve.

I was rudely informed that I would  have to wait another 30 min before I could tan again, and that was Nevada State Law. Ok, its a law I will get over it. (Later I found that other salons don't do this, they only allow 1 tanning session within a 12 hour period). \nThe second issue was last weekend, when I had stopped by with a friend of mine (who doesn't tan there) because we were near there and she said she didn't mind waiting, I heard the employee say to a new customer that he could call ahead to reserve a bed if he was on the way. I was surprised by this and so was my friend so I told her we could go and I would do that. So later I called and the same employee answered the phone, I asked to hold my bed because i would be there in about 15 min and she said \"we don't take appointments.\" I had informed here that i just heard her say that they do to a  new customer and she was VERY RUDE replying \"It's been me here all morning and i didn't say that.\" if it weren't for the fact that my friend heard her say this as well as me, I would have gotten over it, but she flat out lied to me. \nThird, I emailed the customer service department about my issues a week ago and still have not gotten a response.\nAnd today while stopping by there I heard an employee answer the phone asking a customer to hold extremely rudely. \"I asked you to hold on for a moment\" I work in a customer service environment and you do NOT speak to customers this way!\nI CANNOT believe that customers are treated this way!!!
