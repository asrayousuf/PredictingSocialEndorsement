Just got back from there, thought we should give it a try.  We had the deep dish pizza.  Very tasty.  Everything tasted fresh.  They put lots of tomato sauce on it, I like that, usually pizza places are stingy with the tomato sauce.  It's not overly greasy either.  This is definitely above the average pizza place.  I would certainly recommend this.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had been here many, many years ago and remembered it was quite good.  Unfortunately today's experience was not so.  The worse part about the experience was probably our waitress. She really couldn't care less if we were her guests or spent money at this restaurant.  She wasn't rude, but really short with us, and she wasn't busy and we are always extremely nice as we work in the same type of business.\nI got my more or less flat Coke and decided not to bother to complain.  My side salad looked a little sad, not the freshest lettuce.  We also had the French onion soup.  It was excellent but unfortunately loaded with pepper.  Now, I like spicy food, but this was really more of a pepper soup  with onions.  Shame that.  I had the sampler dish with lasagna, eggplant and veal parmesan.  The eggplant was absolutely great, the veal parmesan tasty and the lasagna pretty decent.  My wife had the chicken parmesan, she really liked it.\nAll in all, it was average.  Considering the price and the lousy service, I'm going to rate it two stars (I would rate it 2.5 if I could). It's a shame.  Like someone else said, this could be the perfect little place, but not with this staff and some food being below par.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I think one of the problems is that their food is a little dry.  If you go there, make sure you add extra sauce.  All in all, the flavor of the food is just average, kind of bland.  I expected a little better.  My wife had a bowl with noodles and chicken and didn't like it.  We also had the Yaki's which are their deep fried wontons.  They looked great but tasted average.

We ate an oyster appetizer, served with red vinegar. So fresh, so tasty. Next came deep-sea lobster, three pounds. I have never had lobster that tasted so fresh. And the last thing we ate was killer. Mediterranean sea bass, served with olive oil lemon sauce. Best fish I've ever tasted. \n\nBut really I'm writing this review for the service. They were amazing. I think our waiter is called \"Jerry,\" and he knew everything about everything. The waitstaff worked together on all the tables, and they seem really well-coordinated, and very concerned about not allowing us to keep our plates between courses.

It was my second time and my experience was much improved from the first.  The first time I came here I had to wait over an hour in line to get in, and I got there early.  This time my boy talked to one of the promoters and let us in through the \"secret line.\"\n\nThis place is huge.  3 levels, the bottom level plays hip hop, the main level plays edm, and the top level is pretty much just a little lounge to chill.  I don't know why I can't give this place 5 stars.  It has so much potential.  Marquee books big name DJs to perform on the main stage.  The light wall behind the DJ is incredible.  If you don't like EDM you can go downstairs to get your groove on to some hip hop.  If you're a little tired you can go upstairs and take a break.  There's even access from the main floor to get outside by the pool for some fresh air.  And there's beautiful women everywhere. \n\nHere's where Marquee needs to rethink.  So you decide to make your club huge, 3 levels in fact, but there's a limited number of elevators you can access to get from floor to floor. No one wants to wait 20 minutes to get to from floor to floor.  Then you think it's okay there's stairs. The worst idea.  Nobody wants to walk a million flights of stairs either.  Invest in a ESCALATOR PLEASE!  Also, Marquee has to be breaking the capacity law because it's like sardines in the damn place.  I don't want other dudes rubbing up on me while they're trying to get pass me. \n\nOn a side note: if you get faded, most likely you won't even care about all these problems.  So just have a lot to drink, and enjoy all the potential Marquee has.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0},

One huge change they made is the DJ stage they put up.  The dance floor used to have access to outside, but they put the stage there so you have to walk around the sides to get outside.  Another change they made is booking these big name DJ's to put on stage.  I also noticed the set-up for the line for XS has changed.  \n\nSo, I came here over the weekend for a friend's birthday, and we got bottle service for 12 people.  A little disappointed at the location and size of our table.  Our table could only seat 5 people, and the table was outside, so we couldn't see the DJ perform from our table.  You'd think we'd get a better table for spending a few racks.  Maybe it's because we reserved out table only a week ahead, probably should have done that a month before.  Other than that I had a great time; I was feeling myself.\n\nSebastian Ingrosso was spinning that night, and I have to say he tore it up.  The DJ stage is definitely an upgrade.  Actually feels like the dance floor is bigger.  I must have spent the first 2-3 hours at the table drinking because by the time I got out to the dance floor, I was on. And once I got to the dance floor I didn't leave.  The music was so on point.  It had me fist pumping and jumping for another 2-3 hours straight.  I didn't even mention the lights.  It was like an upscale mini rave in that piece.  Only qualm about the music was it was electronic all night.  I would have liked a little hip hop to bump and grind with the ladies.\n\nI would give XS 4 stars, but here's where they earned a bonus star.  The first time I had bottle service at XS was a couple years ago, and one of the people in our group was over and passed out at our table.  Security then proceeded to kick that person out of the club.  This week was completely different.  We had not one but TWO people that were completely faded and passed out at the table AND it was before midnight.  Security didn't approach to us once!  In fact, we took it upon ourselves to get them out of the club.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

The school is pretty small, smaller than the rest of the Maricopa colleges if I'm not mistaken. But there is a reason why I drive across the city to come to this institution, I love the staff and the instructors who are here at PC, they are very well knowledgable at what they are doing. \n\nI have been attending here for couple of years now and I just like it here, community colleges offer smaller class and get better interaction with the instructor which is the way I learn best, and they are more than happy to help you with anything you need. Plus is cheaper to get your core classes at a community college. \n\nThe parking is a little crazy from 9-12, and 4-7, one time I drove around for 40 minutes until I finally found a parking space. One thing I don't like about this school is the citation they give out, They give you a citation if you park reverse\/facing the wrong way without any warning or anything at all. Well I guess I learn the hard way. I love the fact that Phoenix College have a parking garage, to those of us who knows the heat well in the valley know that that's a life saver right there... keep your car nice and cool without having to worry about passing out trying to start your car, but you go there during the crazy hours you won't have a chance of finding a parking spot. \n\nOverall I am happy with the school and will recommend anyone who are in the area looking to farther their education or anyone who just graduate from high school..","useful":9,"funny":3,"cool":2},

We loved living here until this past year when new management took over.  The office staff are rude and maintenance workers are lazy.  If I have to pay for water I want our leaky bathtub faucet fixed.  The response was to \"crank the knob really tight\".  I may not be a maintenance worker but am smart enough to know that is a short term fix and long term is going to cause a lot more damage..  \nDuring their deals we moved into a remodeled unit with new laminate flooring, cabinets and granite counters.  Unfortunately, just like our old apartment they still install cheapest carpet possible that is not tacked down.  Nothing like walking out of your bedroom in the morning and stepping on them.  They provided us with a brand new dryer and a moldy smelling gold washing machine from the 90's.  We asked them for a new washer and they pretty much notified us we will have to use it till it breaks.  About the smell?  They gave suggestions on eliminating it but of course none work.  \nThe Highlands thinks by renovating they will be able to compete with the local market.  Lets see here.......Regents has dual paned windows vs single pane at Highlands.  Pretty much every other complex in the area have fitness centers twice the size and have equipment that actually work.  There is definitely something wrong with the weight sets here.  \nI love the location and if they can bring back the caring staff and put residents first it may be a place worth staying when our lease is up.

My game had peaked a few years ago at a 6 handicap and I was on a downward slide towards double digits.\n\nI contacted Elite Golf Schools of AZ and signed up for the four-lesson pack after they started teaching out of the club I frequent. Tyler was my instructor and after the past two months I can say that he has helped me turn things around.\n\nAfter 28 years, I finally have a system to play better golf instead of just guessing on what I need to do. Tyler has helped me realize not only that I was swinging incorrectly, but that I need to be aware of why I'm making the mistakes I do.\n\nMore than just swing changes, he has shown me how to recognize why I hit a poor shot and how to correct it. He also helped me come up with checks and drills to continue to evolve my new swing.\n\nAfter the lessons, I've been able to shoot my lowest round in almost a year due to increased consistency and more confidence.\n\nI highly recommend Tyler and EGSA if you are interested in improving your golf game as a whole. Lots of people can read tips on the internet or get advice from people who play better golf then they do, but I now know that it takes someone spending time to explain these things to you and also evaluate how you are actually applying them.\n\nThank you EGSA and Tyler for your help and I look forward to working with you guys in the future when I inevitably start to stray from the path again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Stopped in mid afternoon on a hot summer day with my wife. We were hoping for a drink and a small snack. Before we were seated the manager informed us that they were only serving the tapas menu, which was fine, and we expressed our desire to order food. There was one other table occupied inside the restaurant and we had the patio to ourselves. Apparently our waiter had to cut his smoke break short to attend to us. He came and took cocktail orders and said he would give us more time with the tapas menu. At no time on this 30+ Celsius day were we offered or brought water. When our drinks arrived the waiter placed them on the table, turned around and disappeared back inside immediately and without a word. We assumed someone would return, but were ignored on the patio. We sipped our drinks and eventually finished them. After several more minutes of waiting my wife went inside to tell them we were leaving. The manager offered to send the bill out. The waiter brought it out with a charge for French Fries that we didn't order. He told us it was Quebec law that their liquor licence required a food order. We told him we intended to order food, but didn't have the opportunity as he never asked us. We also told him we had no intention of paying for food we didn't order. He told us we could wait for the fries or not, but we had to pay for them. He lied and said he asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we refused again to pay for what we had not ordered he told us we could pay or just be thieves. We asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived the waiter continued to lie and say that he had asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we told the manager that this wasn't true he grabbed the bill, crumpled it and told us to \"f$!& off\". The manager was extremely apologetic and very nice. He comped our full bill. However, I cannot recommend strongly enough to not go anywhere near this place unless you appreciate comically rude and terrible service.

I showed up for a blood draw at 7:00AM, before the lab even opens and there was a gigantic line. First you have to draw a number to even be checked in  and then you have to wait until your number is called to go back and get your blood drawn. From 0700 to 0723, I waited to check in. Once that was done I waited from 0723 to 0952 to be called back for my blood draw. The blood draw itself took under 40 seconds total.\n\nOn February 17th, 2015 I called and wanted to schedule a Dr. appointment because I was not feeling well. They called me back and said that the next available appointment was today, April 1. I accepted this appointment, having no other choice. As I pulled in this morning and experienced a minor miracle, finding a parking space, I received another call that said that she had called in sick, no I could not see another doctor but her next available appointment was April 22. Having no other choice I accepted this new appointment. \n\nI receive prompt, good-quality mental healthcare at the VA from the OIF\/OEF\/OND clinic but the rest of the hospital is poorly organized, poorly run, and overwhelmed. If this was a civilian doctor, I would be finding another healthcare provider.","useful":15,"funny":0,"cool":0},

All of the tiles in the pool area could use a thorough powerspray or replacement. The sauna has the glass brick window\/walls that are cracked and broken. The mens shower area is actually alright, showers work, lockers work and it does not smell like a gym sock (props to the cleaning staff, who are nice, btw). The walls in the actual gym area are scuffed, marked, and more holey than my daddy's bible. There are at least five spots that I know of that need a hole patched in them. The cardio equipment is in serious need of repair and replacement and some of the cables on the machines are dangerous. Last of all, the hours... I have insomnia so sometimes at 1 AM on a weekend I decide to go get my pump on and it is mildy irritating to have to drive to Mesa Riverview to do so, even if there equipment is better.

But let's talk about the food......\n\nOn my first visit here a few months ago, I had the margherita pizza and the rucola salad. Either I was starving or it really was the best pizza I'd had in a long time. On my second trip here, I got the butternut squash ravioli in brown butter with fried sage - melt in your mouth pasta. It's made in house and it puts all dried pasta in my cupboard to shame.\n\nThis trip, I ate at Taggia twice because I am just too damn lazy to look for other places to eat when I have this place just across the pool. I returned to the margherita pizza again after starting with the asparagi antipasti. Both were delightful, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the trevigiana cheese in the asparagi dish, so now I know. The pizza wasn't quite as insanely delicious as it was the first time, but I still really enjoyed it. Great crust and great sauce.\n\nIn the spirit of being repetitive, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli again and started with the two gazpachos - on one side of the bowl, a summer melon gazpacho, and the other side, a tomato gazpacho. Both were fully pureed (no chunks of anything) and good; however, there was too much sugar in both. Still, I cleaned my plate, because under the sugar (or was it too much salt? something was too much) the fresh flavors popped.\n\nI'll be back. In like 2 weeks.

It's definitely a type of food that is lacking in the area, and I used to love the one in the Annex \/ Christie Pits area. It was a long wait and I went as soon as I could.\n\nThat being said, this place is kind of a let down. The interior decor is sort of nice, but there are WAY too many TVs. They are everywhere - you'd think it's a sports bar. \n\nThe food is way better than the Dundas Ka Chi, but considering the price it's a big letdown compared to the old Annex spot. Simple Bi Bim Bap (with Bulgogi) was $18... and all you get with it is a tiny bit of pickled daikon and kimchi - none of the other little bowls of food you'd typically get (soy beans, glass noodles, etc). So, they're charging you way more than other spots (every other one charges $10.95 for the same) and giving you a lot less. The Annex Ka Chi used to give you a pitcher of tea, I hate to think what I'll get for the same price at this location.\n\nHonestly, this place feels like a moneygrab. I'll probably go back begrudgingly because it's the only spot nearby, but it would cost less to take transit to one of the cheaper locations. If they drop their prices by the 30% they ought to, I'll happily revise my rating and probably take a lot of friends and visitors there. As it stands now, no way.\n\nKa Chi - next time buy fewer TVs and keep your prices in line.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I explained the Yelp deal doesn't specify what package you have to purchase and he offered to check with whoever was in charge. He came back with the same answer and I informed him I already purchased the Yelp deal and then asked him to change the wash to a platinum if that's what has to be done so I don't end up paying double. The whole situation doesn't make sense because in the end the business lost money ($10) by not allowing me to purchase a more expensive package, either way the savings was $4 to the customer regardless if I bought the platinum or diamond so I don't know. Although it's small in the grand scheme of things, it will make me think twice about coming back.\n\nOverall the car wash itself was good and they would've received at least 4 stars from me if everything had worked out as anticipated.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

We called in prior to inform our lateness and the person was so nice and told us we can come whatever time we can.\nFor appetizer, I ordered the chicken liver pate and my friends got the escargot and the salmon mousse crepe. The pate is really flavorful but the side salad tastes even better. The salmon mousse crepe is also really nice and refreshing, but the escargot is a bit too heavy for me. The main course is the best of all. All of us ordered the beef hanger steak, which is incredible! It's cooked in perfect medium rare and the seasoning is just fine. The red wine butter on the top is the best part! It highlights the texture of the steak in such a great way! For dessert, the rum cake is just so so, the crime caramel is also standard, but the warm crepe is way better. Btw, the portion is kind of big for girls which I'm a bit happy cuz I can eat a lot lol.\nThe service is really nice too. The waiter always walk around to see if we need anything, and I think he's really cute. The food is served in the perfect timing as well. The bistro is on the second floor which we had some hard time trying to locate the door lol but a gentlemen downstairs showed us the way in such a cold day.

I've been going to Virginia every month for facials and treatments since 2001 to help stave off the effects of aging.  I count on her products for my beauty routine and seriously count on Virginia's monthly treatments to keep my skin looking healthy and vibrant.   She is first-rate; you will be very impressed with the results.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The guides (Tyler, Liz, Kevin, & Paul) were all incredibly knowledgeable, kind, patience, and most of all I felt safe with them. The ten mile hike into the canyon wasn't easy but well worth it when you see the falls. The best part about this trip was that AOA provided the food, tent, and air mattress. All I needed to bring were clothes, something to carry water, and any other essentials I needed. (I rented a sleeping bag, too).\n\nGreat for group of friends, couples, or solo travelers (like myself).\n\nHike tip:\nThe first 1.5miles is swithcback downhill, then about 8miles of \"flat\", but most of it is loose gravel, and then another 1.5miles of downhill. So be prepared for a workout.\n\nBe advised:\n-Outhouses at the campsite (but if nature calls during the 10mile hike, it's a shovel).\n\n-There are no fires down at the camp site... so you can't \"warm up\" by the fire. Check the weather before you go to pack appropriately. Also, there aren't any cabins... your shelter is your tent.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend using this company!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The hostess asked if I could \"get more people?\". She said I could sit in the bar which was overfilled or the patio instead. \nI said no to the patio and said I would be happy to sit at the bar if she could find seating for us (there was none). She stared at me blankly, confusion. I then asked if we should leave instead of being seated at the available table, response was silence. Just a blank stare. We turned and left.\nAs we drove off to find another sports bar I decided to call and let a manager know that I was displeased. I called and spoke to Jason. Jason said he heard the entire exchange and that it was my fault because I didn't give them a chance. \nI assume Jason is one of the owners children, no other explanation for someone that inept hanging on to a management position anywhere. My wife, son and I will no longer be seen at Zipp's. Way to go Jason!\n\nSide note-\nZipps- Please listen- your patio is a nasty smoke hole. No one that isn't smoking or with a smoker would sit out there. I would love to kick it on the patio when the weather is nice, but you've sold the entire space to smokers, so not very friendly to anyone else out there. (Not bashing on smokers, Zipps says it's a smoking section so no foul on you).","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2},

We just went for the first time tonight. Our waitress was slow and lazy. We waited 15minutes before the server \"noticed\" us (she was busy talking to coworkers). We ordered some sushi and spring rolls. The sushi is cheap and skimpy, spring rolls were bland. We ate less than 1\/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers). With no more to drink and sitting, waiting to get help for 1\/2 hour, the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else. We said \"no\" because nothing was good. She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table. We were comped a good portion of the bill, but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it. Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served, we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal. We will not be back. \nIn summation, the food was poor quality, the service was awful, management is mia. No idea how this place stays open.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},
