I even have a close relative that manages a Walmart store in Wisconsin. This Walmart has by far the worst customer service that I have ever experienced - and I used to live in the SOUTH.\n\nThe workers that I have encountered at this Walmart could not possibly purposely display more \"I don't give a crap about this job\" attitude than they already are. The past 3 times that I have gone in there I have been treated like my time does not matter. They are completely inefficient, slow, lazy, and rude.\n\nThe first time that I shopped there, I had about 14 items and went through the express lane. The lady behind the counter (pregnant) was moving so purposefully slow that it was obvious it was on purpose. She was trying to prove that she did not care about her job and that the customer's time did not matter to her. To get through the EXPRESS lane took more time than if I would have stood in line behind someone with a huge cart full of stuff in a regular line with an efficient clerk.\n\nYesterday, I went in to get a couple of keys made and to purchase some other items. The lady who came to make my key just muttered utterances and sounds under her breath, rather than giving me a \"sure, I can help you with that\" or \"here you go, have a nice day\". She just took my key, made copies, and handed them back to me. Even when I said thank you she just made a small sound and walked off.  Then I stood in line to check out behind a lady who had about 10 things. The clerks name was Darlene. She was, just as the previous clerk, extremely slow and uncaring. She was even SITTING DOWN in a chair, slowly taking one item and sliding it across the laser, stopping in between items sometimes to \"chit chat\". It took FOREVER to get my stuff and get out of there. \n\nI don't expect super speedy service necessarily, but I do expect to be treated with respect. Treating your customers with respect entails making them feel welcome and being efficient.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":0},

When we did finally go out we realized that ALL Vietnamese restaurants in the area close at 9pm as opposed to Chinese places which stay open till 2 or 3 AM.  Why is that anyway? So we felt rushed to find a place quickly.  We chose Pho Cali thinking it looked competent and clean.  As we sat down we encountered the dreaded Surly Waiter.  Apparently someone whizzed in this guys cornflakes today and he was taking it out on us! He thrust the menus at us without a word with a thoroughly disgusted look on his face.  My husband nicely asked if he spoke English. He replied sarcastically \"No, Spanish\". Imagine his surprise when hubby proceeded to order our entire meal in Spanish.  Suddenly pissed off waiter boy spoke English!  The rest of the meal was a constant parry of attitude and sarcasm.  What school of serving did this guy attend?  I didn't check Yelp before going to this purveyor of fine Vietnamese cuisine so I guess I had it coming.  Our experience pretty much paralleled other Yelpers regarding paying the bill.  He added it up then when we tried to pay with American dollars padded the bill due to the exchange rate.  Would not accept our credit card either.  We payed cash and left this fine example of waitstaff one shiny Canadian dollar for the privilege of having him serve us and left.  Suddenly Nasty waiter follows us out to the street and proceeds to pull an indignant Justin Long tirade from \"Waiting\"!!! Oh, HELL NO!  He says \"here sir you left your money on the table\". In perfect English no less!  I said before he could go any further\" oh no you earned every penny of that with your fine attitude\" he got all \"Guppy\" on me opening and closing his mouth and nothing coming out.

My head was on a swivel trying to keep up. Eyes are still dry because I tried not to blink. So much to see, I was in awe. \n\nMore than once I asked. How'd they do that? No one can hold their breathe that long and kick their legs like a Rockette. They're not jumping. Oh crap, they jumped. Shut up did you see that. I'm dizzy watching them spin, how're they not flying to their doom? These were just random thought came to mind. \n\nPeople put in work. No detail missed. Visually stunning. Saw a few people moved to tears. Had my heart racing. My head shaking. My breathe syncopating. Funny, scary, warming--it was moving. Inspiring. A roller coaster adventure \n\nFew hours after the show and I'm still a Buzz. Like the Grand Canyon. . .you make the effort to see it. You will not be disappointed. In time it is certain, one will forget the details of the show. However, Le Reve is a First Kiss. It's something you will always remember.

Back home you could find one every couple of blocks and my absolute favorite is Wing Wah (Oh, how I miss you, cue the water works.)  \n\nI had tried a few places here and nothing came even close to my most cherished Wing Wah.  I'm used to fried rice being brown thanks to that yummy, salty soy sauce, not white like what I'd gotten here.  Fried rice should not be white!  \n\nAfter being let down so many times I just gave up on finding Chinese take out.  Then, one day I was informed of House of Leng.  I scoffed at the recommendation because my heart  nor my taste buds could take the potential disappointment.  However, one evening when the Chinese food craving bug kept biting me I decided to give House of Leng a try.  I ordered the Orange Chicken with fried rice.  Yes!  The rice was actually brown and tasty.  The chicken was okay just not my favorite.  Naturally I had mixed feelings but did at least have some place to go to if I just wanted fried rice.  A couple of days later my co-workers were going to House of Leng for lunch and invited me to go so I did.  \n\nBased on a recommendation, I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken with, you guessed it, fried rice.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  The chicken was delicious and went perfectly with the fried rice.  Portions were large yet I ate everything on my plate.  My co-workers all starred at me in shock because they are always teasing me about my picky eating habits.  Even better was that my meal was only $8 or $9.  Say What!?  I still miss Wing Wah, but the longing isn't as strong as it once was.  Finally, I've found my Chinese take out place in Charlotte!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1},

Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \"Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"  \n\nOne of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \"I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.\n\nWhen it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.

Where else can you go to get a dining room set, cooking utensils, a shower curtain, earrings, the candy you ate in Japan that was so good you almost cried, the lager that knocked you off your bar stool in Germany, and the coffee that left you awake for 2 days in Italy?  No place, that's where.  As if this wasn't enough they throw in free wine tastings on Saturdays!  What?!!  Every time I walk into this store my mind is blown.  \n\nI regularly get Cafe Du Monde beignet mix, which is much cheaper than flying to New Orleans every time I get a craving, various snacks, and a variety of wines from all over the world.  Next up, is Pomula Passion Fruit Wine Spritz from South Africa which was on sale for $4.99.  Although the store offers sales frequently, you can get even better deals if you sign up to be a World Market Explorer member.  Like I said, I LOVE THIS PLACE!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2},

I come here so often that some of the employees recognize me. \n\nIn addition to the store's bountiful, bevy of items and groceries there is also a decent cafe that serves snacks and Pizza Hut plus there's a Starbucks.

Upon entering this particular Marshall's I expected to find lots of good stuff since the store is so large, shiny, and new.  \n\nThere are carts, baskets, and shopping bags right at the entrance that customers can use to make shopping a breeze.  I grabbed a basket and headed straight to the shoe department which is larger than most other Marshall's.  I found several pairs of shoes that I liked, but to my misfortune none were in my size.  \n\nI then meandered over to the clothing section and was left longing for a better variety and more clearance items.  My basket kept saying, \"Fill me, fill me,\" but I couldn't because I just wasn't finding anything that said, \"buy me, buy me\".  \n\nNext, I went to the handbags section and the sky began to open and the sun came shining through.  The selection of handbags is great especially if you like designer brands.  There were several Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Cole Haan, and Vince Camuto bags.  I had been looking for a new, small crossbody and found a pretty frickin awesome, turquoise Kelsi Dagger bag for $24.99.  I couldn't believe it!  It was originally $198.  Jackpot!  I snatched it up faster than the blink of an eye even though there was no one else around me.  I put the bag in my basket and walked up to the register with a smirk on my face and extra confidence in my walk.  \n\nSo, to sum it all up I'd definitely go back to this Marshall's for more handbags, shoes if I can find my size, but may not bother with the clothes.  I didn't really look in the home furnishings department but from a quick glance it appeared to be limited.  I'll take a closer gander on my next visit.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

For the amount it was going to cost to have my furniture shipped from my hometown I could basically purchase new furniture for my Charlotte apartment for less.  \n\nKnowing that I was going to be under a tight time constraint from when I moved into my apartment to when I would begin working, the sales consultant at my apartment complex suggested that I rent furniture.  My complex has an agreement in place with Cort Furniture in which apartment residents are able to rent furniture at a slightly lower  than regular rental rates.  I was able to select a furniture style (contemporary or traditional) and for $99 a month my entire apartment was furnished.  No that wasn't a typo.  $99 a month for a completely furnished apartment!!\n\nI had a bedroom set with mattress, dining set, couch, accent chair, cocktail table and end table and two lamps.  What was really great was that the furniture had already been delivered before I moved in.  Woohoo!  Although my mattress was pretty uncomfortable I was so happy to not have to deal with shopping for furniture right away.  \n\nWhen I decided to stop renting my furniture cancellation was as simple as 1-2-3.  Well, actually just 1.  All I had to do was cancel at least 30 days before I wanted the furniture to be picked up.  On pick up day two guys came in and carried off the furniture in almost a blink of an eye.  \n\nWhether you're new to Charlotte like I was or are in need of new furniture but don't have to time or money to purchase yet Cort Furniture rental is the way to go!!!","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I look up and see that the restaurant is at the end of the strip mall by the Family Dollar.  Obviously, I'm thinking where in the heck has my friend brought me.  I walked inside and was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was warm and inviting and the place was packed.  \n\nMy friend and I were lead to our table and our server explains that we can get food from the buffet as well as order food from the kitchen.  I went to the buffet and ended up with a plate of 4 or 5 grapes and 2 pieces of pineapple.  I had no idea what the other stuff was and I wasn't about to find out.  So, I ordered some eggs, bacon and brioche french toast from the kitchen.  Thank goodness the french toast was included in the buffet price because I got not 1, not 2, but 3 orders.  I'm not the type of person that over eats but I simply couldn't stop.  If I hadn't of felt my pants tightening around my stomach I probably would've gotten another order.  \n\nTo sum my experience up, the buffet was a little pricey at $20 not including any drinks but the service was great and that french toast is palette blowing.

Nope, didn't do that either.  I did however, make the almost 40 minute drive from where I live to the store smiling and giggling all the way like a school girl with a crush.  I arrived expecting to leave the store with at least 2 bags full of loot but instead I left with crushed hopes and dreams :(  The selection of clothes, shoes and accessories was pretty underwhelming.

The boutique has two sides: the upscale side and the consignment side.  The upscale side carried brands like Valentino, Miu Miu and lots and lots of St. John which is generally worn by a more mature and refined woman.  The prices on this side of the boutique were pretty high.  The cheapest thing I saw was a blouse for $150.  There is a clearance rack but I didn't see anything that I would even consider wearing.\n\nThe consignment side of the boutique is geared more towards women who were born in the 1970s and beyond.  The brands that I saw on this side included: Juicy Couture, Marc by Marc Jacobs, and BCBG just to name a few.  Again, the prices were a bit high in my opinion, but definitely more affordable than on the upscale side.  This side also featured Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Coach handbags.  \n\nI will say that I found several clothing items that I liked but wasn't willing to pay for them as I don't really need another pair of pants, jeans, shirts, sweaters, jackets, dresses, or handbags.  Nowadays I only buy things if they speak to me and a montage of events in which I will wear the items flashes through my mind.  I did find a few items on the clearance rack that I liked and ended up buying a pair of Joe's Jeans.  The original consignment price was $69.50 (way too high for used jeans) and I got them for $17.  I have at least 4 pairs of Joe's Jeans all of which were purchased brand new and I've never paid more than $50 for any.  \n\nI would go back to Sweet Repeats but only under two conditions.  1) I was already in the area as I wouldn't make a special trip and 2) would only purchase items from the clearance racks on the consignment side.

If you're not into combing racks for buried treasures resale shops may not be the places for you.  For me finding great deals on some awesome clothes is almost like winning a game even though your team was down with only 5 seconds left on the clock.  Perseverance plus dedication to the win (landing multiple good deals) = VICTORY!  However, if you're not as hard core as I am but still like going to the occasional resale shop let me help you navigate this store.\n\nThe Wearhouse is very well organized and divided into two sections.  The front section of the store is consignment which includes the designer brands.  I've seen brands from Marc Jacobs and DVF to J.Crew and Seven for All Mankind.  These items can be a bit pricey but you can still find some really good deals.  Towards the back of the store is the thrift section.  Some of the brands I've seen in this section have been Express, Forever 21 and those that can be found in any typical clothing store.  The thrift items are significantly less expensive than the consignment items but there are more to sift through.  \n\nThe great thing about the pricing of many of the items is that after a specific date the price goes down.  For example, you've just found a jacket in consignment in which your mind flashes through all of the different places you will wear it and the numerous compliments you'll receive.  When you snap back to reality you realize that although the jacket may enhance your life, it's a bit more than you want to spend.  No worries, just look on the price tag and there is information on the exact date in which the price will be reduced and what it will be reduced to.  \n\nAnother great perk about shopping at JLC Wearhouse is that there are sales all of the time.  There is also a frequent shopper program in which you can get 30% off of a purchase after you make 5 purchases of $25.  Sounds great right?

We attended a bear and cupcake tasting and once again the service could have been better.  It was definitely an improvement over the last time and my friends and I were able to get separate checks which was one of the issues I had before.  Although our server was really nice, we had to ask for the same things multiple times before we actually got them.  When we got ready to go one of my friends asked for the check and our server brought only hers.  My other friend and I had to wait about 10 minutes before she came over to our table again.  So, I'm saying it again, I wouldn't suggest going here but if a friend invited me to go I probably would just knowing beforehand that we probably won't get the best service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We had all heard of it but none of us had been before.  All we knew was that it was a place for us to have a drink or two or three.  Who's counting.  \n\nMy friends are beer connoisseurs or enthusiasts if you will.  I on the other hand am not.  I don't know the first thing about beer except that what I've had in the past I didn't like.  Fruity cocktails are more my speed.  So, I was thinking to myself great I'm going to have to sit here and watch my friends celebrate as I sip on a Sprite.  Woohoo!  Lo and behold there are mixed beer combos that are sweet.  Yay!!! Who knew.  Maybe you did but I sure didn't.  \n\nI had the Hummingbird H20 and it was yummy.  I then tried the Snakebite which wasn't as yummy but it wasn't terrible.  Our server was great and really knowledgeable about all of the drinks (the Snakebite wasn't her recommendation for me but I was being adventurous).  Which is quite impressive since there are hundreds to choose from.    Greatest part was that the drinks were cheap.  Only $5 a piece for my tall glasses of brew.  Definitely a great place to chill with good people and kick back a few.  There's also a full menu.  Always best to drink on a full stomach just something I learned over the years :-)","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Although it's not a meal (wish it was) my favorite thing to eat from here are the green beans.  Instead of getting two different sides with my order I get two orders of green beans!  I have no idea what makes them taste so good.  The only conclusion I've drawn is that they're laced with some type of drug because I'm addicted to them!!  \nThe rolls with cinnamon butter are also delicious.  I've gotten full off of them plenty of times.\n\nOn top of the great food the service is also really good.  There are also plenty of tasty treats on the drink menu.  Try the Jamaican Cowboy on for size.  This is a great place to bring your friends and family.  The prices are reasonable and this place should exceed your casual dining expectations.  I know they exceed mine!  \n\nSince this is a popular restaurant if you go between 6:30 and 8:30 you may have to wait a bit for a table.  It can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends.

I've worn braces twice and had to have 8 teeth removed in the process (Four of which are my wisdom teeth.  Does anyone know why they're called wisdom teeth?).  After all of that you better believe that I go to the dentist every six months religiously.  Well, that was until I moved to Charlotte.  Moving to a new place is always fun and exciting in the beginning but the novelty wears off when you begin to think about practical things like, \"How do I find a good doctor, Where do I take my car for service, What's a good salon (I'm 0-2)  \"Where do all the cute, SINGLE, guys with jobs hang out (Hey, how'd that get on the list?), and of course How can I find a good dentist that knows what they're doing and won't cause me to have to take a bottle of Advil when I get home?\"  \n\nSo, one day I'm checking my email and I get one from AmazonLocal Deals, which is really just LivingSocial, and I see a deal for Healthy Smiles Family Dentistry in Concord.  $55 for a cleaning and x-rays!!!! I said to myself, \"It has been 9 months, 12 days, and 14 hours since you have been to the dentist. Buy the deal!\"  I bought it.  Now, I was a bit skeptical about going to a dental office that I found on LivingSocial and so no joke, I prayed that it would be a smooth visit and indeed it was!  \n\nDr. Stainback, her husband Horace, who's the hygentist, and the receptionist are great!  They were all really nice.  Surprisingly, I had a great time at a dental office.  Never thought I'd ever say that.  Horace even took pictures of my teeth with a little camera on a wand that fit in my mouth.  I had never seen anything like it.  He then showed me the pictures and went over them with me in detail so I would be able to understand the dental lingo when Dr. Stainback came in.  \n\nThe best part is that Dr. Stainback's service prices are really reasonable.  I don't have dental insurance but was thinking about adding it to my medical plan and decided not to after I was given Dr. Stainback's prices.  It's cheaper for me to pay out of pocket than to purchase dental insurance.  I've found my dentist and couldn't be happier!  Now I just have to find a good salon and a male companion (Dang, another slip of the tongue!)","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":2},

The servers' uniforms of jeans and tshirts sort of clashed with the aesthetic, but it is nice to see comfortable employees. \n\nI tried the elderflower seasonal cocktail and loved it: sort of a toned-down floral lemoncello. I also enjoyed the house salad (mixed greens with tomatoes, roasted red peppers, feta and oil) and the crabcakes were scrumptious (as was the aioli; love the hint of lemon!). If there was filler in there, I couldn't detect any! My partner, however, was disappointed that his burger came out much more well done than he had ordered. We both agreed the side of fries were almost inedibly salty. \n\nI ordered a lemon tart to-go, and when I opened the bag later, delightedly discovered a sort of assemble-your-own they'd put together so that the tart wouldn't get soggy. It included the tart, four little sauce cups (two with delicious lemon curd, one with minted blueberry, and one with pureed strawberry), four blueberries, and chips of sugared crust for garnish.

The food is excellent!\n\nI've loved PDQ's Concord location since it opened, too. Until my last visit, that is (7.10.14). My family and I have eaten there often but this last trip was a disappointment. We were there around 12:30 pm and everything seemed normal--staffing, cleanliness, good customer traffic, ordering experience--until I picked up the tray for the four of us. \n\nMy chicken tenders (3pc. meal) appeared to be about 70% of the size I'm used to. Maybe that's imagination, maybe the H'ville location has me spoiled. Still, it's not what I remember from PDQ Concord. Chock that up to a subjective determination, but one that made an impression nonetheless.\n\nWhat was objectively different from every past experience is the temperature of those tenders. Usually they are too hot to eat without some cool down. Not so this time. The flavor was right but smaller and just warm = no bueno.\n\nAnd the fries were objectively unusual too. They were limp and a tad oily instead of their usual crispy. Luke warm, not hot. Very disappointing.\n\nSo, has People Dedicated to Quality moved to some \"make it ahead, hold it 'til it's dead\" production model? I don't know, and wouldn't think so. I'm thinking the \"Chef Coat\" who essentially signs off on every order wasn't doing the Quality Control part of his job very well that day.\n\nThat's enough of a review to make the point. No need to detail the experience of my wife and daughters beyond the common theme: This trip wasn't what we've come to expect from PDQ. \n\nObviously, as I'm writing this review a week later, our sub-par experience made an impact. In hindsight, I should have cared enough to speak to one of the chef coats. My bad--I'll do better if it happens again. My hope is that it was just an off day and not a sign of problems leading to decline. We'll see soon enough. I want PDQ to thrive.

We ended up booking him right away (and at a fraction of the cost of the more expensive ones we were considering).  People loved the food!  It was spicy and full of flavor but not too spicy for the old gringos.  The ingredients were fresh and packed with flavor.  My only complaint was that the pork dried out a tiny bit, but every other bite was fantastic.  People also loved the southwestern corn side dish.  We would DEFINITELY recommend these guys and would use them again if the need arose.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
