The swim objectives at each level are clearly demonstrated to the kids during their lessons.  All of the staff, both in and out of the water, are very personable, helpful, and accommodating......whether it relates to fear of the water, scheduling lessons and makeups, a child having a bad day, or swim techniques and advice.

Today was my first and last time coming here.\nLet's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, \"Hello?\" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with \"Yeah.\" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, \"Yeah, sure,\" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.\nSo, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, \"You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,\" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.\nFast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.\nIf you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":0},

An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation.

THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!!\nSo my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like \" YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS\". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.\n\n  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.\n\n\nJust revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1},

Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.\n\nThe prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.\n\nMy wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.\n\nIf you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a \"preference.\"  She even threatened to \"call security on us\" if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for \"misunderstanding\" Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a \"preference.\"  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with \"calling security\" due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of \"teaching us.\"  Although we went on to have a very nice dinner at T-Bones that night, Yumi's behavior toward us soured our entire experience.

I've encountered no shady characters lurking around, nor have I seen any signs of storage areas having been damaged or broken into.Â It's very nice to feel safe and secure about one's person or belongings. Thanks, again, to the facility and to the staff.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had a \"Chile relleno\" the menu said light fluffy batter, I got a hard green chile in an omelet. It was NOT good at all! Our waiter was ridiculous.  We saw him 3x the entire time we were seated. I had to flag him down to get the bill. It's ashame, Lake Las Vegas is a beautiful place to visit.  Next time we'll just get some gelato and call it dinner!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We had to clear the dishes from a table first of all so we could sit. The place was so over crowded as to be a joke for a business class perk. The food is next to non existent. The only thing it has going for it is free booze which is only good for the real boozers in the crowd. For the price you pay for business class, especially international they could do a lot better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Lovely atmosphere, top notch service! The chef made me a custom pasta dish, and I mean completely custom not just modified.

No pesto flavour to be had as it was pesto penne advertised, mushroom was so thinly sliced could not even taste it in all that cream, no flavour at all.

You will not want to go back to Panera tea after you've had the brewed mint tea. Iced tea is just as good. I don't know what he does or puts in it but this man knows his tea. \n\nThe food is simple, a little plain but good. Never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil, the pitas are warm and fresh (and you get  two so they will fill you up) and I actually like the kufta here better than Layalina's which is saying something because I love that place (but am not a fan of their kufta). Lentil soup is also tasty and filling. The  falafel does leave something to be desired.\n\nI also don't mind the guy behind the counter. If you absolutely must be kowtowed to with fake enthusiasm and mock-pleasure to serve you this is not your place. This guy smiles at you its genuine.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They said they'd still have some old familiar items on the menu but would have new stuff too. So keep an eye out for Butitta's!\n\nUPDATE 11\/20\/2009: They have a banner outside the building announcing they are now hiring servers and will be opening soon!

They've added about a half dozen more tables, have some privacy screens up, decor is cute. Workers were earnest and ready to help. I had the mango green tea and it was tasty, not too sweet, hint of green tea flavor and the jelly was soft and fresh. Only three bucks for a medium too. Service only took a few minutes, no line, just steady customers, few people sitting down. No complaints here!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}]
