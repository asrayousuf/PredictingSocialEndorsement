But then it all went downhill.  The seats were uncomfortable.  The staff seemed confused by everything.  The food was abysmal.  If we could give less than one star, we would!\n\nLet me describe in more detail: literally every bite of food was sub-par, and we ordered four courses.  The fancy quesadilla was literally a big basic tortilla with pre-shredded American cheese.  I could have done better at home easily.  The \"burro\" had some major problems--chewy meat, crispy tortilla in the wrong way (dry), and beans that will immediately send you into salt overload.  The flautas were so greasy and unappetizing that we just said no.  I've never seen her send food back in my life.  Dessert was lame.\n\nAvoid this place at ALL cost. .

The process up to was fine, emailing sketches to me for approval, tweaking and stuff. I felt good going in. Her artwork was great and she is talented. However, when she put the stencil on my body I did not like the fact that some of the petals, vines and filigree flowed below my butt crack line. She said she would make the petals closer to that area smaller no problem. I repeated myself sternly because I wanted to make sure petals werent going to end up in my butt crack or too far down. She said ok she would tweak it on my body. My issue was that I didn't want the vines to go all the way from my left hip, to all the way my right. So I understand she tried to make it flow from top left to bottom right. I sat in the chair for five hours no breaks. Because of the detail and shading, and the fact the cover up grew significantly larger in size, I definitely was in pain. You can tell the artist was getting antsy and annoyed, to the point where she was rolling her eyes... which I find extremely rude. Finished product; beautiful work, but the only thing I didn't want? She ended up doing. The petals flowed lower than I wanted, and the filigree flowed onto my right ass cheek. When I saw it, I didn't even know what to say.... I was so pissed I just paid gave a cold shoulder thanks and left.. I mean what can I really do now anyway? When I wear jeans, two inches of my tattoo detail is covered. If I had known it was going to flow so low, I would have just made the vines completely symmetrical. I was mad that I was mislead. IF she had told me no, those petals need to match the other sizes of petals or for whatever reason it'd still end up under my butt line, I honestly would have just made it symmetrical. I'd advise you to find another place that treats your customers with respect. And a place that actually CARES and listens about what you want.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":2},

We ordered a lot, 2 of the \"large\" sausage and cheese samplers, the loaves of bread and creme spreads, jerky sampler, petit fours mix, salted caramel petit fours, Brownie Cups, butter cookies, brie wheel, cranberry chipotle cheese, cheddar cheese, the butter cheese (Can't remember the exact name) cheese curds, and that flat fried cheese that looks like the Greek dish called Saganaki. So this was not a small 1st order, really, I was stupid for ordering so much without having any experience with them, and let me tell you why:\n\nFirst off, I live in Tucson, AZ and while it is December, the days still get well into 80 degree temps. This arrived through USPS, everything was in its own separate shipping box, (One box completely crushed, but luckily no damage, but that is on USPS, not the Cheeseman) and I do mean EVERYTHING was in separately addressed shipping boxes! It was about 10 shipping boxes all stacked together and wrapped in a sort of plastic, and then 3 or 4 loose boxes. For all being in different shipping containers, I received 3 ice packs total for the entire order, which were completely melted and not even cool anymore upon arrival. My brie wheel was a floppy mess! All cheeses were at that stage just before melting, very, very, very soft. I didn't have the heart to look at the chocolate, but I probably should. I just know if I open those Petits or brownie cups, they will get eaten long before Christmas day...lol \nI just don't understand why they have all that packaging but hardly any ice packs for such a large order going to the desert. If they don't pay attention to where they are shipping in order to pack appropriately, they should. You wouldn't pack an order destined for Michigan, right next door to Wisconsin and much cooler, in the same way that you would to the desert in Arizona. Not only does it take longer to arrive here, but it will face different temps and heat in the mail trucks than the one going to Michigan or what have you.\n\nOkay, so we start opening boxes and I come to the loaves of bread and creme spreads. All I could do was laugh; I buy on eBay a lot and a huge issue I have is ordering something and when it arrives it is either gigantic or tiny compared to what I thought I bought. Yes, I check measurements, but for some reason this still happens. So anyways, I was \"ebayed\" on the bread loaves. These loaves are about an inch and a half to 2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Hardly a loaf, perhaps a loaf for an 18 inch doll, but not full size humans. I would feel like a doofus serving someone thee tiniest slice of bread ever. The loaf itself is about one serving. Just a fair warning. The \"large\" sausage and cheese packs were the same way, maybe an inch and a half in diameter by 3 inches long? I knew they wouldn't be full sized amounts, they never are in sampler packs, but even so, I was shocked at the price to size ratio.\n\nGranted, the only thing I have opened and tried were the butter cookies and they're okay.

Why not real honey? Anyway,  these issues still stand even if this food is the yummiest I've ever had once we eat it. That is why I didn't wait until eating it to review.

Biggest mistake I ever made. When I got the car back it had adhesive and fingerprints all over the fenders and doors, as well as a chip in the drivers door. Unfortunately that was just the beginning. A few weeks later I was cleaning the inside of the windshield and noticed something odd on the passenger side of the windshield. So I brought my vehicle to the Porsche dealer to have them look at it. They told me that they Penske Auto Glass had torn, and broken the windshield antenna ribbon when they installed the new windshield, and that the windshield would have to be replaced once again. I did not trust Penske to replace the windshield again so I had another company (Ever Ready Auto Glass) replace it for me. Upon removal of the incorrectly and damaged Penske windshield the Ever Ready installer pointed out to me that there were tool marks left on my rear view mirror from the last install. Yet more damage to my vehicle from Penske Auto Glass. \n\nMY ADVICE IS TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM PENSKE AUTO GLASS.\n\nIn response to Lindsey C's comment from Penske.\n \nI asked and I sent them the estimate for the repair of the chip they put on my door for $511.38, I also asked them to replace the rear view mirror their installer damaged with tool marks and sent them a picture of that damage. Lastly I asked for just $250 for loss of income and my time since I have had to take hours of my own time to bring the car to be repaired, and for estimates as well as hours of additional time I have spent dealing with all of this nonsense that They Penske Rapid Repair has caused. \n\nI addition have emails from Penske stating that they had not and would not bill my insurance for  the bad windshield repair. Here is the then actual quote from Jan 2 2013 ( \"Geico has not and will not be billed for the work performed.\" ) as sent from Tabitha Wall, Operations Manager. \nYet they did bill Geico,  and were paid for the work they said they would not bill for.  \n\nSo much for being true to their word.\n\nFurther more Lindsay C from Penske in her comment stated \"We have refunded the entire amount for the work performed to his insurer \" , but as of today Feb 14th 2013 according to Geico they have not yet done so. \nAgain it seems that they have made another false statement of truth.\n\nLindsay C also makes this statement that they \"have politely declined repeated requests for monetary compensation for his dissatisfaction\" \nThe only single email request for compensation I have made was an email sent to Tabitha Wall at Penske to compensate me for the repair of my vehicle, that They Penske have damaged, and to recoup a small amount of money for all of the time I have had to take off, and spend rectifying the damage they caused to my car. I have not been unreasonable in any way. \n\nSo I paid for my new windshield out of my own pocket $952.19, and have yet to be reimbursed from my insurer because as my insurance company has informed me that they have yet to be reimbursed from Penske, and since they consider this a warranty issue because of the damage Penske admitted them they caused, they can not pay me until Penske pays them back. \n\nI also have recorded phone conversations with a Penske rep Tabitha Wall taking responsibly for my door chip, yet they have refused to pay for the repair, or provide me with a replacement rear view mirror. \n\nSo one should ask themselves this. \n\nWhat kind of business would damage your vehicle, admit that they did it, and then tell you that they would not bill your insurance , and then turn around and bill them anyway, Refuse to pay for the damage they caused, and then try to make you look like your the unreasonable one with a reply to your opinions and statement on yelp of what they Penske have been putting you through, and then also try to imply that they are perhaps the victim here and you are wrong. \n\nAnswer: Penske Rapid Repair. \n\nPENSKE RADIP REPAIR STOP YOUR NONSENSE, AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND PAY FOR MY REPAIRS FOR THE DAMAGE YOU CUASED TO MY CAR. \n\n\nI will post a link here soon to all the recored phone conversations, photo's and emails.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":0},

Entry gates that break and take forever to get fixed. I could not tell you how many times cars parked outside got broken into also.  The grills never had any propane in them. Management was awful, and Mark Taylor is a joke. \n\nThere is so much more I could go on about, but let me just use this example to put it all in perspective. \n\nThe review from Scott M on this page, well you have to pay $25 extra for the trash pick up at your door and its not optional they make you pay for it, plus you also have to pay for the trash disposal fees on top of that.\n\nSo why would he leave that out of his review?\n\nWell maybe its because his wife Michelle M is the property manager for Pietra.\n\nAlso I found his review of Pietra when I followed his profile link from the one star review he made on Raintree Auto body in Scottsdale. \n\nA shop that did an awesome job on repairing my car, and a review that he gives that I believe as much as his review on Pietra.\n\n\n\n***Update*** \n\nThe only five star review made by Scott M, Who's wife is Pietra's property manager is now missing. Imagine that. \n\nSincerity Definition: the quality of being free from pretense, deceit, or hypocrisy\n\nYet Pietra's property Manager, and Mark Taylor employee Michelle M did not address the fact  that her Husband Scott M made a glowing 5 star review of Pietra were he compared Pietra to a resort. \n\nA clear violation of Yelps Content Guidelines as I listed the relevant section below.\n\n(Conflicts of interest: Your contributions should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn't write reviews of your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' business, or businesses in your networking group.)\n \nNo she instead thanked me for my feedback and then attempts to make one think that it is better, when little to nothing has changed besides new motors for the entry gates. \n\nI think yelp readers would rather have a sincere explanation and an apology instead. \n\nInstead she just ignored the issue, and then tried to provided more reasons why Pietra is so nice. \n\nTo me that says it all. \n\nNow\n\nAs far as a Security Patrol.\n\nWell Michelle M the property manager states \"we have made a lot of improvements here at Pietra.\"  in an attempt to make it sound like it is a new service, but that was there when I lived there, and is more of an on call service as they are not on property all night long. They were slow to respond and and almost never on property. \nThat would be the reason in Michelle M's response she states ( \"We have a courtesy patrol service that is AVAILABLE after hours\") \n\nAVAILABLE in that statement being the key word.\n\nSounds to me to be misleading.\n\nAs far as increasing the number of dog waste containers.\n\nBig deal as it does not change the fact that people still have to have the desire to clean up after their dogs, and management needs to do a better job in both enforcement and clean up. \n\nNow for what they call Valet Waste Disposal. \n\nMichelle M may have tried to make it look so affordable at just .83 cents per day in her response, but that still does not change the fact that they make you use the option for an additional $25 fee as you can not opt out. Plus again you still have an additional waste disposal feel as well to take the combined trash away in the dumpsters. \n\nOh and that reminds me about how so often the residents dirty smelly trash would get piled high up outside the dumpsters. It looked so nice every time you had to drive by it.\n\nBottom line is that my advice is to stay away from Pietra and any Mark Taylor managed property\n\n\nThese are of course my opinions based on my experiences with Mark Taylor and Pietra.","useful":15,"funny":2,"cool":0},

TJ gave us papers to sign on all the inventory of our furniture and boxes and said that the price may change a little but it shouldn't be that much, that he had a pretty good eye about these things. What a joke! They won't actually give you an exact figure until everything is loaded on the truck so you are at their mercy. Once the truck was completely loaded the price of our move increased by $2300.00. I don't know about you but for us; we are on a fixed income, that was like slitting our throats. After finding out this new amount, we literally had to borrow money from others to be able to get our furniture across country to our new home. Cost up front is half by cash or personal check. At your destination, you must pay cash or Postal Money Order; which means you have to buy about 3 money orders because the post office doesn't sell money orders over $1000.00.\n\nWhen Britany took our deposit, she tells us that she would make certain that our furniture would arrive as close to our move in date as possible. When your furniture is already loaded on the truck, the foreman tells you it could take up to 5 weeks, no guarantee on the delivery date. Just another way of making your move more stressful.\n\nWe got to NC on the 21st of January. We stayed in a motel and at my sisters a few nights then tried sleeping on the floor at the new house. We called West Coast Movers for several days and left messages. No one called us back until finally I left an email message letting Britany know how unhappy we were with West Coast Movers. The truck driver called us and told us when we should expect them, then Britany called and wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise. I finally said would you please stop and let me talk. She was telling me that she was brought up right and that she wouldn't work for a company that she didn't believe in. Please!\n\nOur furniture arrived and even though our driveway is about 3-4 times the length of the tracker trailer, the driver said he couldn't bring it into our driveway. First that he couldn't get it in our driveway, second the DOT wouldn't allow him to bring it on our driveway that it might cause damage. His helper said we could sign a waver but the driver said no. He wanted to charge us extra to bring it up to the house. I told him we weren't paying an extra dime that it wasn't our fault that he couldn't and wouldn't park in our driveway. After getting heated over this, both myself and the driver, he said that they would carry the stuff 75 feet and drop it there and refused to go any farther. I told him that they weren't getting their money and he said you don't get your belongings. I called West Coast Movers in Nevada and spoke with Ashley who was really kind and seemed to care about our situation.  She spoke to the driver and asked that they wave the charge of  the extra steps to get to the house and move the contents into the house and set it up as we had paid for. The driver wasn't happy at all but they started to move the furniture and boxes into the house. As they began, I noticed how horribly packed the stuff was in the truck so I went out and started taking pictures. The driver immediately stopped working and called West Coast and said my husband was helping unload the truck and that I was taking pictures. Ashley called me after that conversation and said that wasn't acceptable and my husband needed to stop and wanted to know why I was taking pictures. I explained my reason and she said that they couldn't stop me from taking the pictures but not to worry, they were working to get us a refund on our move due to our experience being so unpleasant. Up to that point the experience with West Coast had been horrible and you would think it couldn't get any worse. It did! We had to sign the paper saying we received all our goods; which at that point we had no idea since it was about 9:00 at night and we were exhausted after such a long day.\n\nCan't finish too many characters for Yelp.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It's not just authorized, it's actually charged.

We were rushed to catch the shuttle- I noticed my glasses were missing by the time were arrived at LAS. Luckily, we had time to catch more shuttles to return to Fox rental, where also luckily our car was still in the lot. Guess what? No glasses. We talked to the manager, who supposedly went and asked the car detailers, and they didn't have them. At this point we had to get on the shuttles AGAIN to catch our flight. The 1-800 number on the receipt is wrong- it doesn't connect anywhere. I googled and found another one, and had to call twice to get connected to a call center. After 3 passings around by operators, I got the HR office and left a message. \n2 days later (today) I received a call in the morning from HR who told me they didn't have them (duh). I'm certain a detailer took them. HR told me she'd call me back same day and didn't. \n\nI realize my mistake was misplacing them, but it's pretty obvious someone took them, and that disappoints me.

First time in was during happy hour. Ordered off the happy hour menu and was very pleased with the entire visit and I would have given 4 stars at that time. Today was a different story. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table, ok if busy, but restaraunt was basically empty, but was told we had to wait to see if people who made reservations would show up. Finally seated and were given water by a waitress who was over the top perky. I appreciate upbeat people, but dont talk to me like I am a child at the doctors office, you come off as fake and irritating. Two of the water glasses had black stuff at the bottom. Showed to waitress she commented that it was probably fruit flies. It looked like cracked black pepper or small bits of charcoal to me. Glasses were removed.\nFood was ordered and arrived in a short amount of time. Appetizers were ok, but the dipping sauce for both the pretzles and chips were  bland..Ordered a firebrand chicken sandwich, was told the the bread was a flatbread, their version of pita bread. Turned out that it was served on a pretzle bread\/roll, which tasted ok, just not what was advertised. I had their black angus burger. Dissapointing to say the least. The smallest 1\/3 pound burger I have ever seen. Small plain bun, two pickle chips, two limp red onion rings, no lettuce or tomato, and a petite amount of ketchup that was not enough for the burger, let alone the fries. Asked for more ketchup and mustard, another petite portion arrived. I am a big boy, I can handle a ketchup bottle, I promise not to waste or make a mess. The flavor of the burger was the dealbreaker. It had a intense chemical taste, at first I thought a gas grill flavor, but the more I ate the more it tasted like charcoal lighter fluid.I did not finish. \nI have no problem paying top dollar for my food, but I expect to get what I pay for.

You hear the reception phone ring- every time. The lobby TV like it is in your room. Old towels were in our bathroom upon arrival with hair on them. The towel rack was coming out of the wall.

So of course when visiting another state we like to venture out from your normal chain restaurants. Did a little research, and the reviews were awesome so we decided to give it a shot.

This is probably due to the fact that they are absolutely understaffed with one person working the tables, front etc. Once seated we were not even served water, absolutely nothing until we asked ourselves to order. I feel bad for the one waitress who has to do everything so it is not her fault, just unbelievable they have one person doing everything. Once we ordered we did not receive drinks until we once again asked for them,  or appetizers for 30  minutes. #1 rule = food quality is irrelevant with horrible service. I really hope this place gets it together because it's in a great location and looks great as well. Honestly worst service I have ever seen.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},
