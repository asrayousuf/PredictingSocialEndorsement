I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and we found our meal extremely substandard.\n\nThe draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good, so no complaints there. The food menu was focused, but one lingering question hovered over us while we browsed it:\n\nWhere the hell is the bacon?\n\nFor a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pÃ¢tÃ©, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.\n\nThe cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points\/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS. The thing was slightly larger than my face and came with a mountain of \"pommes frites\" (Black Pig's terminology). It looked like something Adam Richman should tackle on a Man Versus Food challenge.\n\nThe huge portion size to price ratio couldn't save the uninspiring flavors. The fries were ridiculously salty and I didn't even bother taking the sandwich home despite leaving about 3\/4 of it on the plate. \n\nDespite costing $6 more, the pork tenderloin dish was much smaller and tasted as bland as it looked - plenty of brown and green on the plate but very little flavor. The pork was juicy at least, so not a total loss.\n\nOverall it was an extremely disappointing experience. The food couldn't live up to the menu, which overhypes its descriptions with meaningless adjectives - \"free range\" toad-in-a-hole, \"nettled\" risotto.\n\nWe'll probably come back for drinks, but my advice is skip the food.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1},

She said she'd need time to \"request and review my file\", and advised me she'd call back with details. She didn't.\n\nI followed up a few days later, and she consented that she'd reverse the annual fees charged to both my account, and my girlfriend's. She didn't.\n\nI called back the following week, and spoke with \"Linda\" who informed me Amber was out sick, and she'd be reviewing my file. I politely stopped her there, and told her Amber had already told me to expect a refund. She again stated she'd have to research my file (Incidentally, what sort of \"file\" is there? I mean we are talking about a 1 sheet gym contract, right?).\n\nAt any rate, she did call me back that afternoon and told me the refund had been processed. On 5\/14, roughly 2 weeks later and 5 phone calls later it was resolved.\n\nBottom line, it was too much of a hassle. If it wasn't for the fact that they reversed the annual fees, and that I can walk to this gym, they'd be at 1 star instead of 3.\n\nhttp:\/\/davidiwritestuff.blogspot.com\/","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It was on a whim as we had a Groupon.\n\nI'd have to say that the tour was informative, and gave perspective of how a small business was run (if you've been on any of the big distillery tours like Jack Daniels you'll notice several distinct differences). The tour was given by one employee while the owner waited at the bar until we were done to provide samples.  While giving the tour to a group of maybe sixteen people, the employee encouraged us to ask questions and kept the air of the tour light while joking throughout. As an added bonus some of the jokes were even funny! Kidding aside, levity was definitely there, without feeling forced or bordering on the lame. \n\nOnce we got through the informational portion, we all bellied up to the bar and got ready for our samples. Jason, the owner greeted every person, asked their name and shook hands. Which I thought was classy, and was certainly a throwback to a bygone era of how business was done. \n\nJason talked through the history of each spirit (Moonshine, Bourbon, Gin) and connected us to how they came into being as well as how he decided upon their names. In doing so, he also informed us about how he had gotten into the business to begin with. Personally, I found this portion extremely relatable and inspiring, though I won't spill it here, and would advise you to visit the business on your own to hear the tale.\n\nAs far as the booze, I'm not a Gin fan in any form, but otherwise the Bourbon and the Moonshine were excellent. \n\nOverall, a great way to spend an hour, particularly if you have friends or relatives in town, or to simply support an Arizona small business doing quality work!\n\nhttp:\/\/davidiwritestuff.blogspot.com\/","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Feeling so insulted we then proceeded to call the corporate office and they said they would have someone call us that was in our district. They still have not returned our call. Overall i think that this pharmacist should have some repercussions for her attempt to \"play god\".","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The nurse shift change is at 7:30 pm so there was a meeting of Nurse leaving, me and nurse coming on duty ... that would be Dave.  We went over all my meds and that I was also due pain medication at 8 pm (now 7:40).  It was also discussed that my Doctor ordered an IV fed antibiotic also to drip during the night.  I called for Dave at 8:30 and asked about my medication which were due at 8 pm.  He said he was busy but would get to me soon.  At 9 pm I called Dave again who informed me that I would not be getting the pain medication because I had not specifically requested it at 8 pm. He also informed me that he decided not to do the  antibiotic drip.  I told him that I wanted both medications or I would \"unhook myself\" and go to a different hospital.  I told him I didn't feel safe with him and that I would be submitting a formal complaint in the morning.  That seemed to change his attitude and He finally agreed and gave me the meds sometime after 10 pm.  Dave avoided me most of the rest of the night.  Next morning I asked to speak with Dave's supervisor.  Someone came in who didn't really seem concerned (like this happens all the time).  While she was there my doctor came in for a routine checkup on my condition.  I told him what happened the night before and he immediately asked for the floor manager to come down and speak with me and take a report.  The Manager said she would be right down.  This was at 6:30 am and in spite of my reminders, the floor manager never did show up or contact me.  I think Dave is dangerous.

This was our first home build so we were very overwhelmed with trying to design our backyard.  I did a ton of research and talking to people about the best pool company in our area.  Hands down, Presidential was the top recommendation.  We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!\n\nWhen our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course, I had soooo many questions.  David was always very responsive and easy to contact.  \n\nAt the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.  He went step by step on the chemicals needed to keep our pool balanced.  After a week of owning our pool, I feel very comfortable being able to maintain our pool myself because of all the information Jason provided us.","useful":9,"funny":2,"cool":1},

I thought that reserving a room like that over the phone (and even paying for a night up front!) would get me the room I needed but no, there is no way to be sure that you're getting what you want or pay for at this place.\n The check-in procedure took AN HOUR thanks to an incompetent chump and sassy desk manager (she started giving me attitude like it was my fault they didn't have my room available!  wtf?) while my girlfriend sat out in the car, surrounded by drunks, in their driveway.  If that wasn't bad enough, this front desk hassle made us too late for my special birthday dinner!  Where I had a hook-up!  This was the first night in Vegas and already Mandalay Bay was losing me time and money!\n That night, I tried to put our expensive leftovers into a fridge but discovered that the only mini-fridge in the room was full of beverages that you couldn't move or else the computerized weight system would charge you immediately.  So, no fridge!  Even Super 8 has a mini-fridge!  We went to bed that night enraged.\n The next night we ordered $22 nachos from room service (there was a $5 \"cover charge\" ... just another cutthroat fee at this place).  I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?\n Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me \"did you enjoy your stay with us?\" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  \n \"Disappointed\" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.

Sunday morning breakfast for 2, arrived at 9:30 and seated right away. \n\nRoom wasn't full, but at least 5 other tables near us were people who had placed orders and waiting for food. \n\nServer was pleasant and took our order (a skillet and an egg dish (clearly not memorable)).

I went early to avoid waiting but was starving by the time the food arrived.\n\nThe food was tasty and not a bad price for a decent portion. The service, the slowness, not my thing. I can understand leisurely meals or waiting when the room is full or the staff are busting their butts. This wasn't the case. \n\nI likely won't return. But tip for anyone who does - order the scones with your breakfast. Saw other tables get those early on, probably tides you over to distract from the extremely long wait.

I don't do these often, as it is not in the family budget, so I was looking forward to it. And the place looked nice and shiny inside. Well, I was completely disappointed with the results. First, the pedi.The \"spa pedi\" I asked for didn't include the removal of dead skin cells with the razor or other scraping tool. The woman gave my feet a quick 10 second brush with a pink pumice and then on to the \"massage\" she prided herself on, which lasted for a whole 60 seconds at best and was nothing special. That was a huge disappointment, as this is one of the parts of a pedicure it's hard to pull off at home. I am prone to having ingrowns, so I was VERY specific that the woman should cut straight across for the pedi, leaving the corners alone! Well, she cut the nails straight across, but then she got fierce with the nail nipper. Before I even knew what she was doing, she had cut at a diagonal on the corners of one of my big toes. Worse, when I got home, I realized that she had actually visibly CUT the cuticle on the side of that same toe, further down. And I had to treat it with antibacterial ointment for several days before the pain and swelling subsided. Also, I noticed that the tools she used seem to be in her own personal toolbox, which was fine, but I have no idea if they were floating around in water or in some sort of antibacterial solution. I am praying it was the latter. [Note to self: next time look for a place that assigns you your own set of tools and stores them for you or clearly shows you how their tools are kept clean] As for the shellac mani, the woman piled on so much and so many layers of polish that it looked and felt as if I was actually wearing fake nails! And the so-called \"2 weeks at least\" shellac manicure lasted a whole of four days before the shellac bubbled at the edges and began coming off of the nails in large swathes.  Never again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

He spent the time to look over everything we had had done already, came to the house, spent almost two hours walking through and highlighting things to us, explaining the significance, etc. Then he gave us detailed information about what he would do, what things to watch out for, and what he would do in the meantime. The thing that impressed us the most is he didn't charge for any of it and even told us things that we could do (e.g., renting air movers from Home Depot instead of from him) that would be more convenient for us but lose him money. I wish everyone could be like Bryan - awesome service and great explanations. Definitely seems way more above board than some of the more popular mold remediation outfits.","useful":1,"funny":17,"cool":0},

He had extraordinary reviews, so we provide this one just to present our different experience.\n\nHe was immediately reachable, very prompt with arranging a home visit, and always very confident in his assertions.  While his speed in identifying our problem and readiness to discuss his (possibly excellent) credentials repeatedly would be a positive to many, we felt that he reached his conclusions a bit TOO quickly and mentioned his background and all his competitors' inadequacies TOO frequently.  Possibly just a clash of personalities, but...\n\nWe weren't feeling confident in the diagnosis and remediation he proposed and looked for another opinion just to do our due diligence (but we are certainly NOT experts).  We subsequently learned of a few red flags:  \n(1)  MoldEx does their own specimen collection (not the actual testing, though) which other contractors believe is a conflict of interest (i.e., there's an incentive to find a problem and to prove that the work has resolved it).\n(2)  A more thorough inspection revealed an entirely different source for our moldy smell which would NOT have been addressed had we gone with the MoldEx remediation plan.\n\nDuring this process (before we found what is likely the right source), we contacted Daryl to ask a few follow-up questions, planning to hire him.  I must have given him the (totally incorrect) impression that other contractors were standing by to do the work for us, because his brief response was that he was busy and must pass on our job.  \"I'm sure the people providing you with this information will be more than happy to take care of you\", he replied.  We took this to mean that he was offended by our potentially getting other opinions.  We felt rather put off and left a fairly scathing review.  Next day he called to inquire about it (I appreciated that).  I explained what our concerns were and that we did not, in fact, have any other options available to us.  I revisited my questions with him; he told me he'd talk if I took down the review (I was unimpressed with that).  He called the next day when I hadn't, then tracked down my spouse's work number and left a message there.  We were left with a fairly sour taste.","useful":15,"funny":41,"cool":0},

It was in a wonderful shrimp and mussel sauce, and perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender!\nHubby loved the oysters too! \n\nThe pasta was definitely rich, but there was a je ne sais quois missing... maybe the lobster needed salt? Some kind of spice missing? Perhaps there was so much hype around this dish that it just fell short of my high expectations! However, the portion was more than generous! I couldnt finish the pasta!

The food was delicious, the ambience was spot on, music selection was great! ... but let me get to the food.... \n\nHad the fried smelt, first time trying this, were delicious, perfecr with the spritz of lemon and then a mayo dip, could have had more! Hubby had the oyster special and loved them. \n\nThe octopus a gallega was tender, and wonderful. But the highlight for me was the squid ink risotto... EAT THIS ... i could have eaten this for every dinner... it was rich and delicious, with a little smokiness from the spicy chorizo, tender little baby squid tentacles, peas, and baby cilantro sprinkled on top. The prawn and scallop served on top were cooked to perfection! Get this, you wont be disappointed!!!! \n\nThe only downside here was that they were out of the crispy chicken skins for the night, which i was dying to try, but they must be good if they ran out! \n\n5 stars, will recommend to anyone who takes the trip out to mtl.

The last time I went there, I waited 30 minutes on my food with 10 people in the place. I got the grand slam which comes with coffee and choice of juice. I said I wanted orange juice for my juice. I never received my coffee and when I asked about it, the waitress said she thought I only wanted OJ since I didn't ask for coffee. You would think that it was implied that I wanted coffee. Do I have to ask for every thing? Do I ask for hash browns when it says it comes with it? There is a problem every other time I go in this Dennys. I've had sausage that was frozen inside.

The interior is different but nice. We were seated and asked our waitress about the specials. She began to tell us and then a woman with short blonde hair interrupted and rudely said the happy hour specials don't start until 2200. I guess she's the manager.

The music was at a nice level, not too loud. All of the staff was very professional and attentative. Not much bad to say about Bistro 57 besides its location and the fact that Aliante Casino has the tightest machines outside of the strip which keeps the casino kinda empty. In Summerlin, this place would be packed on the weekend.

While the staff is accommodating the manager \"Justin Parker\" will interrupt and make rude comments.  Be aware the deposit for this location is $300 or $100+cost of the rental, which ever is higher.  I was not aware of this unusual policy and when I said the airport location doesn't charge a $300 deposit, Justin said \"Well go and rent from there, that is our policy\", and he glared at me.  Then my daughter offered her Visa debit card and they said she had to have \"2 Utility bills with her name on it\"....really, who travels with two of their utility bills immediately in their possession?  We were unable to rent the car, they close in 1-hour and the wedding we had to drive to was in 3 hours.  Then Justin Parker (the manager), told the driver \"take these ladies back to where ever\", really loud in the office, it was humiliating.  A good manager shows leadership and has the skills to handle a difficult situation, not insult customers and send them on their way with tacky behavior and rude remarks.  It was weird, like he got some kind of thrill showing off how he could treat us.  \n\nI have rented from Enterprise for at least 20 years, and this is the first time I have ever been treated in such a shabby manner.

At this point I have 4 pieces of designer glass\/chrome pieces of furniture missing (of course, they didn't photograph these four furniture items but there's a glimpse of the coffee table in one of their overall photographs with everything pushed together so they could remove a designer sofa -- still wet with water from flood which they took immediately for the weight factor for insurance pay) a brand new Kohler faucet still in manufacturer's box (no big deal in comparison to my furniture!) that one of their workmen kept placing in a \"throw away\" pile in driveway.  I removed it three (3) times out of the pile!!  Two of their workmen were involved in my garage placing whatever they desired into the \"throw away\" pile.  I stopped the job the following day -- unfortunately, with my house drenched in water and a different agreement the job resumed.  The adjuster was no help as far as advice in this situation.  I had a bad experience with this company from Day 1 of the pack out (trying to steal items) and the furniture they returned is banged, scratched and one of the sofas has rips in the fabric.  It's a black exquisite, contemporary, fabric (special order) and had some fade due to all windows (tons of sunlight) but was in perfect, excellent, condition when they removed them.  No one ever sat on them except during holidays.  \n\nInsurance companies shouldn't send these type of companies to their clients' homes.
