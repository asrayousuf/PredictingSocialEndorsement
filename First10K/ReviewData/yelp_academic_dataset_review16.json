Not exceptional, but decent. The pad kee mao was quite good - slight hit of spice without being overwhelming, and the noodles weren't overly oily as other reviewers are complaining (maybe that's a pad thai problem?). The basil beef with egg was amazing. Not as spicy as it would have been in Thailand (most Canadians are spice wimps so I don't blame them for toning it down, although you can request spicier or mild) but excellent and authentic flavor. The egg was also a highlight - fried to airy crispiness on the edges but still with a runny yolk to break over the rice.  Portion sizes were just right, the prices were very reasonable (at the low end for Toronto Thai restaurants), and there's a discount for paying with cash.

I just moved from MN and my car was overheating. I took my car to the shop and explained the situation. They are very nice but that does not mean that the advice they gave me was right. They played the guessing game with the car looking at the water pump, temp sensor, thermostat, which were all options. They had told me that they had ruled out a blown head gasket, which I was pretty sure was not the issue as I was not leaking coolant anywhere and never needed to fill up.\n\nAfter being there almost a week they had asked me if they could take it to another shop, but would have to charge me because they were being charged. I agreed and the diagnostic came back as a blown head gasket. I found this odd and they texted me a picture of the diagnostic, which showed that they actually were not charged for the service. They had quoted me that it would be $3,100 to get it fixed, which also seemed really high. I paid the $90 diagnostic and picked my car up 7 days after delivering it.\n\nI was going through a bit of a cash flow problem and limited my driving and washed the temperature. I noticed as the temperature started to cool recently, the car would have to be under extreme stop and go traffic or if I had my a\/c on low the temp would rise to the 3\/4 mark.\n\nYesterday I took my car to another guy. He quickly determined a few issues that were causing my problem. He stated the radiator was not operating properly and the radiator fans were working intermittently, as well as they were weak when actually operating. He did this from his house. New radiator, new radiator fan motor, transmission flush, and labor it cost me $550. I put my car through a test today driving around for an hour in stop and go traffic and blasting the a\/c...... the problem has been fixed. \n\nSO the company that did the diagnostic? I thought this was a GM dealership as he had stated, I checked with the 2 dealerships within a few miles of their shop, my car was not taken to either one of them. They also stated that a blown head gasket at their shop would only run about $2,200. That was at a dealership and was $900 cheaper than this place. Plus they did not take it to either dealership, so I am not sure where they took it for the $90 they charged me and of course was a wrong diagnostic.\n\nThe trust factor with this place is now gone. I felt I should update my findings as I previously appreciated their due diligence, but now feel a bit ripped off.

Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, \"We are closed.\"  I replied, \"Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.\"  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, \"Well I'm closing my register.\"  \n\nAt 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, \"I'm closing my register.\".  I said in return, \"We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.\"  Where in she stated, \"Well we are closed.\"  I said, \"You won't let us make a purchase?\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.\"  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm\n\nAt that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, \"We are closed.\"  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, \"Well our registers are closing.\"  I looked at my watch and said, \"It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?\"  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, \"Close it down.\"  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, \"I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager told me to close the register.\"  I replied, \"Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.\"  She said, \"Yes.\"  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.  They treated me so meanly and made me feel as though I was being kicked out, when all I was doing was buying a blouse and being a loyal customer.","useful":7,"funny":10,"cool":1},

Tim Brown, son in law of the owner, was assigned to us.   Tim came out to look at the property and we gave him the plans for the pool that was installed as well as the Plot plan for the house.   We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.\nIt appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.   I guess that the demand for pools and landscaping is strong enough that some builders that are not big enough to perform certain jobs find it easier at the last minute to withdraw, having wasted valuable client time.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza\/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen\/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners\/managers!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1\/2\" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a \"large\" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff \"celery\" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.\nAs for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like \"did you want soup\"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!

I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food.

First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, \"hold on,\" wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere.

I've tried all different times and it's just consistently bad--even when the owner is there. He seems to just wander around doing nothing and not noticing that people aren't being attended to by the servers.  Refills are hard to come by and the delivery of the food is strange.  After waiting for awhile, someone at the table may receive an entree when nobody else has even been served their soup or salad.  I want to like them, but they make it very hard.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

In my opinion, their chef is one of the most skilled I've ever encountered because they are making delicious dishes that you don't at all feel like you're missing out on stuff from (as you sometimes do with GF\/vegan dishes). \n\n- Everything is fairly priced for what you are getting. \n\n- Their raw desserts are AMAZING and have no added sugar! \n\nI love love love Eden- I only wish they had more hours & more locations :)","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

While the therapist I saw today was super nice, I honestly feel like I just got oiled rubbed on my skin for an hour. While I can only hope that if I had requested a Deep Tissue massage over the Swedish that it would have been more worth it, honestly- the pressure was non-existent. \n\nWhat was even more upsetting to me was that the whole reason I went in for a massage was because I was having some neck issues and made sure to make it known to the therapist before the session began that was what I wanted to focus on...and she basically just did a typical body massage. I've had many massages and that's what she did- no focus on the area \/reason I went in there in the first place. And the fact that I paid $70 (not including tip) for this makes me uber regrettful. Sure, I could've complained and tried to direct her movement and pressure but you don't pay that much money to go in there and do that. \n\nI feel like this place has a lot going for it but I think it would be greatly beneficial for the therapists to do more of a \"consultation\" with the client to see what it is they want exactly and then make sure they stick to that.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0},

This menu is wonderful, a WIDE variety of things, many I have never seen in Pittsburgh before. We ordered some of every type of meat (the chorizo was our fav!), some wings, guac (delish!) and the plantains for dessert.\n- The waitress was great- I think it would be helpful for them to have more than 1 server for the entire restaurant because the poor girl did look a bit frantic at some points but she handled it well for being the only server there. \n- The cost is super reasonable and allows you to try multiple things on their menu which is great, because believe me, you'll want to. \n\nCan't wait to go back!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},
