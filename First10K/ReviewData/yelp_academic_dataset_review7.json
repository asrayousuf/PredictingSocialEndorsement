I chose the salad bar option, which was poorly stocked. The selection did not look all that appetizing.\n\nWhen ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.\n\nFrankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere.... If you're in the area, you'd be better off at Red Robin,","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate.

But the two other dishes were fine -- spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza. The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go.

We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern.

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\n\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\n\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\n\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b\/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\n\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\n\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \n\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\n\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.

Anyways, after my rejuvenating, relaxing, and gentle facial, I was gifted another sample. The Clove Gel! Immediately after using this gel, my redness calmed down, my oils weren't as crazy, and I definitely saw improvements on my face.

I didn't even feel him take out the old retainer to put in the new jewelry! \n\nFor future piercings, I will be back. Also, if you are thinking of getting anything done, do it here. You get a gorgeous selection of jewelry as well as skilled hands doing the job.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Everything from how family oriented it is to the quick and easy combos they offer. Nothing makes it feel more authentic than the homey atmosphere and friendly workers that have been around forever. Tom, the owner, always remembers everyone's names and picks up conversations right where you left off. \n\nPricing is extremely affordable and the food is delicious! I love the Dan Dan noodles the most. Such wonderful flavors and always have enough for the next day. \n\nThe only con I've experienced is the lack of service sometimes. However, keep in mind, traditional Asian food service is extremely casual and they try not to bother you while you eat. \n\nIf you're looking for a quick, inexpensive bite of Chinese, I'd stop by!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":3},

I grew up without proper dental visits, resulting in 4 decayed molars. \n\nAt 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. \n\nFrom 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. \n\nFinally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. \n\nIn the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say \"oh no\" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. \n\nI genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was. \n\n*the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well. It's pretty family-oriented in there so they tend to remember you!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},
