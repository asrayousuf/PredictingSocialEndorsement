Also, my parents who are elderly had an issue with their furnace last winter. As always you  got to worry about people taking advantage of seniors on stuff like this. . I did not have this concern when I suggested they used this company. They treated them very well and did not take advantage of them one bit.

In 6 years of renting apartments in the Phoenix Metropolitan area, my tenancy at this complex has by far been the most dissatisfying. \n \nI moved into a 1 BR apartment late Oct of 2013 and experienced issues with the unit from day one. The unit I moved into was promoted as an upgraded unit with brand new appliances, countertops and cabinetry. Unfortunately those promotable items ended up being the only pieces of the unit functional or satisfying. The rest of apartment seemed to have significant issues that were either overlooked or quickly patched during re-construction to sell the unit. Within the first couple of weeks I noticed a number of issues with the apartment and relayed those concerns to management. \n \nSome of the issues included a washer\/dryer stackable unit that only released hot water and that did not dryer most likely as a result of being overused and outdated, a toilet that run water for nearly one minute after flushing and dispels a foul odor akin to mold regardless of how often it is clean, a ceiling fan in the living room that shakes dangerously when turned on, and a floor that vibrates uncontrollably for extended periods of time throughout the day. These concerns are matters that should have been taken care of prior to moving a tenant into the unit but nonetheless they were brought to management's attention. Initially the matters seemed to priority of the management but  soon I learned that my expressed concerns were of little importance to management and my satisfaction as a tenant was irrelevant. \n\nI spoke to management a total of three (3) times and still have yet to see a resolution to any of the matters. Each time maintenance comes to the unit they claim to address issue yet nothing has been fixed or even modified and management has not shown much concern to the matter. The toilet still had the same issue due to an inaccurate analysis by maintenance, the washer\/dryer still had not been serviced properly and the floor still vibrates noticeably throughout the day. The head of maintenance even came to the unit and promised to resolve all the issues but that was over a month ago and nothing has been fixed. \n\n As a result of this lack of care, concern and professionalism regarding the issues in the unit I have requested to vacate the unit early. Instead of addressing the issues and adjusting their approach to keep me as a satisfied tenant management chooses to contest me on what fees I should pay as a result of my lease termination. The property management wants me to pay a fee to break the lease even though it comes as a response and a result of their lack of care and professionalism.

I have attempted to collaborate with management to vacate amicably since the maintenance concerns are of little importance to them but instead they choose to lobby for me to pay for their lack of attentiveness and professionalism. \n\nI am even being asked to pay an extra nine (9) days worth of rent after my letter to vacate indicated and management agreed upon. Management further attempted to overcharge me for December's rent for an overdue charge that they still cannot explain or validate its origin. If matters had been addressed prior to me moving in the unit or even promptly once brought to their attention I would have been much happier with my experience in the complex and would not been forced to move on. However the management seems to be only concerned with selling units not providing potential tenants with homes up to standard quality of living. \n \nOverall I would say my tenancy at Sycamore at Scottsdale has been abysmal. The management of the complex seemed to be satisfied with over selling and under delivering; my business only seemed to be valued to sell a unit. This has been the worst experience in my rental history and would not recommend this complex to anyone any time in the future.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My boyfriend got a a 6 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes a chopped salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms and grilled shrimp. I opted for the Napa Chicken with the corkscrew mac n cheese w\/bacon. \nThe highlight of our meal had to be the shrimp. It was cooked perfectly, and who can go wrong with lemon and melted butter.  The rest was just not very good, the steak was overcooked, and the sauteed mushrooms were not fresh, they were undoubtly from a can\nThe chicken was cooked well but definitely needed salt, and pepper. The chicken came topped with artichoke hearts roasted tomatos and Portobello mushrooms. The tomato and mushroom were fresh, but the artichokes were pickled and it threw the taste of the dish off. The mashed potaotes and mac and cheese were the same as the asparagus and were mediocre at best, and the salad, well it was definitely from a bag and I wouldn't be surprised if the dressing was as well. \nAfter tip the bill was close to $70.

There are big signs that say \"Rental\nCars.\"  We follow the arrows and walk and walk and walk some more to a\nfaraway hall.  But the rental company  (address: Toronto airport) that\nwe booked with, Economy, is not represented there.\n\nWe are told to return to the terminal and find a train to \"off-site\nrental car companies\".  It's hard to find the train but eventually we\nboard and travel to an outdoor area where we are told to wait for a\nshuttle.\n\nEventually 15 to 20 other people join us as we wait in the hot summer\nsun for more than fifteen minutes.\n\nOur shuttle van arrives, but it is so small (or has taken so long to\narrive) that there isn't enough room for the people waiting.  We wait\nanother fifteen or twenty minutes for the next shuttle.  Then there is\na ten-minute drive to the so-called \"airport\" car rental company.\n\nThe line is long and the service frustratingly incompetent.  When we\nask how to get to our destination, they say they have no maps\navailable for customers.  It takes one or two more enquiries before\nsomeone grudgingly goes off to find a page that gives directions to\nvarious areas.\n\nThere is no page giving directions back to the rental place. It's near\nthe airport, he says.  When we finally get our rental car and drive\noff, it is nearly 2 hours since our flight arrived.\n\nReturning the rental car a few days later, we are greeted with the\nsame surly service, but this time they tell us there's a scratch on\nthe car.  We say we know there's a scratch because it was there when\ntheir own employee checked the car before we drove off.  They say but\nthere's nothing on your form.  They find the man who checked the car\noriginally but he looks at the form and says it doesn't say anything\nabout scratches so they will have to get an estimate for repairs. This\nhas all taken a very long time so we say we will have to continue the\ndispute long distance.  They give us the form to sign but there is\nalready a drivers signature at the end.\n\nWho signed here?  You did. But it's not my signature. Oh well, just\nsign next to it.  Now hold on a moment, something is wrong.  Why does\nit have the wrong signature?\n\nFive mins later he admits they were working on the wrong form, for a\ncar that looks like the one we rented.  No wonder there is no record\nof scratches.\n\nThe correct form is missing so they draw up a completely new one and\nsay we won't have to pay for the scratches. We sign.\n\nBy now we've lost all confidence, so we check the total more closely.\nWhy is there a daily amount for insurance? Because you didn't email us\nproof from your insurance company that you have insurance.\n\nI know I did because I remember thinking I had never been asked to go\nto that trouble before. Well, we never received it.\n\nEventually he checks on his computer and finds our email and removes\nthe charge.\n\nWe are dismissed and by now there's no more space on the departing\nshuttle so we'd have to wait for the next one.\n\nExcuse me, something is still missing.  Yes?   An apology. Oh. I apologize.\n\nWell I think the least you owe me is a car ride to the airport.   He\ncalls his driver and tells him to take us - not to the airport but to\nthe train station.\n\nThat's the story of our experience with Economy car rentals, \"at\"\nToronto airport.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":0},

Now I'm not trying to sound like an ass, but we did drop quite a bit of cash so yeah I'm not a real big fan of some random sweaty guy basically sitting on my lap. \n\nThe staff was cool, from the VIP host to the bouncers that kicked the mentioned sweaty douchebags out of our seats.  The waitresses are something else.  Definitely a place for the guys to go if you want to see gorgeous girls in lingerie pouring you drinks.  \n\nWe got there around 10:45 and at about 11:30 we got a surprise you can't even pay for.  25 strippers from Spearmint Rhino were seated next to us.  Now I know some of you girls just aren't understanding how lucky we were.  That's like hitting the jackpot of VIP for us guys.  What's even better is that they had their own booze so they didn't even bug us for ours.\n\nI kind of blacked out after we drank two thirds of our bottle of Grey Goose so the rest of the night is kind of sketchy,  There were a decent amount of good looking girls and some guys too, for you ladies.  \n\nWe closed the place down at around 4, but to be totally honest with you I have no clue how many people were still there because that part of the night is a blur.

We arrived around 5:30 p.m., and although the restaurant was only 1\/3 full, it took awhile for our server to come to our table after we were seated. We ordered a carafe of wine, which at $25, was a little pricey. It shouldn't take long for wine to be poured, but again, for some reason it seemed to take awhile for drinks to be served.  I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and the sweet onion tart, my husband ordered the arugula salad, on son ordered the baby back ribs appetizer, and our other son ordered the butternut soup. When the appetizers were delivered to the table, the sweet onion tart was missing. I pointed it out and it turns out our server failed to enter it into the system.\n\nThe baby back ribs (4 total for $8), which we all split, were disappointing. The sauce was tasty, but the ribs were tough and had very little meat. In fact, I gave up trying to saw anything off mine. The octopus was the biggest disappointment. It was extremely charred and overcooked to the point that it was nearly as tough as the ribs. The arugula salad and soup were good, according to my sons. When the onion tart ($7) arrived, it was small...probably only three inches in diameter.\n\nThe entrees were extremely small servings for the price paid. I understand that local sourcing of highest quality ingredients can be expensive, but I just don't get how a restaurant can charge $21 for a pork belly entree that is literally a little bigger than perhaps a king size candy bar. Even worse, the pork belly was braised with capers, mushrooms and beans...a very strange combination that didn't work together. \n\nMy 13-year-old son had the duck breast ($22), which was good, but consisted of approximately six to seven bites.\n\nOur total bill without the carafe of wine was $150. Even after ordering appetizers and entrees, we left hungry. This restaurant doesn't live up to the hype and billing that the Binkley name has received.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My husband's pork was a little over done and the owner Sean came over immediately to make him a new one.
