The staff are very dedicated to their craft and will help anyone, at any level. I would recommend the intro series for the new students, or the basics class. The staff will get to know you by name, and personally help you. Even in a large class you may feel like you are having a private yoga session, especially with the owner Mary Beth.\nAs others have mentioned, this place is truly a breath of fresh air in Phoenix. When I am tense all I need to do is go to yoga and it all washes away. If I need some deeper intervention, desert song is hands down the best place to get a massage in the valley. The practitioners can root out your stress and rub it all away. After a massage here I feel as if all of my stressors in life have magically disappeared. There's nothing that even comes close. They've ruined me for everything else.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Superstore? Not really. They don't have a huge selection and then they direct you to their website. If I wanted to buy something online then I would have bought it online! They also have no return policy, which for a mostly online store, strikes me as a bad practice. The store itself is dusty and disheveled, with badly designed window units. David's Bridal seems high class compared to this. However, they do have a good clearance section. It's in the section of the store where the broken display items and torn signs are.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

We also had a salad, pretty good but small for the price, and an appetizer. This was the mixed rellenos which were a little better but missing...something.  My fiance had one of the rellenos with beef in it and he said it was grisly. All together, the bill came to over $80 for one salad, an appetizer and an entree, plus two drinks.

I normally wear a size 12 to 14 in \"street wear\" and don't have any problem buying clothes at normal stores, so I don't even consider myself plus sized. However, after the last place literally brought me to a panic, I bit the bullet and called Strut. Ann, the owner, was able to get me in last minute.  She was incredibly warm, asked me about which gowns i liked, and even pulled a few that I wouldn't have otherwise tried on. Guess what I fell in love! And with a dress I wouldn't have thought of. Who knew I had a waist? Ann did!  She was great, incredibly friendly and most of all, warm. She made me feel like a bride. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone who has had a similar experience. I definitely felt no pressure to buy, but I just knew that dress was the one.

This is not a fancy gym, but for the price you really can't beat it. I, like many other posters before, go a little farther to avoid the 20th street one. Yes if you come on weekends and week nights it may be crowded.  However, I've never had to wait for a cardio machine so no complaints in that regard whatsoever.\nI've been to a few classes too, and now have experience with personal trainers, so I'll give my input on those.\nThe good: I Love love love Katherine for cycle. I've been to spin studios and she seriously kicks butt. She had a sub a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to cry the whole time because Katherine is so much better.\nI also really love Cassandra for personal training.  She works me hard but knows how to modify the exercises. She's really nice and understands weight issues, injuries, etc.  She kicks butt!\nYou can watch tv and charge your iPhone at every cardio machine! Woohoo!\nThe bad: ugh I hate step class. I'm not sure if I really just hate the step class or if it was the instructor, but its boring.\nThe ugly: My personal training assessment was not so good, mainly because of the kid who did it was not too sympathetic to my struggles, and said some things that sounded judgmental, ie \"how long have you been overweight?\" Me: my whole life. Him: \"really, why? (In a snooty tone)\" That's just one example. I feel with a little customer service skills that could have gone a lot better. High pressure sales, belittling don't usually work on me, and I had gone in there already deciding to sign up for personal training, so it wasn't necessary at all.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1},

I would never want to publicly say something mean about a place of business; however my experience at Garage Boutique left me no choice but to sign-up and post a review. I have never, in all my life, been treated the way I was treated in this store. Picture Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman on Rodeo Drive; however a. I am not a hooker and b. Garage Boutique is not a shop on rodeo drive. The only similarity is the snotty, arrogant, rude manager\/owner-whatever she might be.  I was not looking to simply browse that day.  I  was on a mission for a few gifts and found them in this store. Never-mind making a purchase, the sour customer care made it impossible for me to actually give this boutique anything more then a look of shock at their nightmarish treatment of potential customers. Simply put, do yourself a favor and shop somewhere else. All their designer merchandise can be found online or in stores that actually represent the kind people of Arizona and not the vapid management from the Garage.  I am returning to Arizona with a group of girls who are pregnant\/have children. We will not be going to this store; which is a shame because they did have some cute things. \n\nOn principle, I refuse to give them any business. There are better stores in Arizona that do not operate under the premise that you should feel honored to be able to shop in their store. Business must be good to treat people the way they do.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":0},

To top it all off on the 12th floor (The lounge is on the 12th,Ha!) the service staff is just straight up friendly. I've sat at the bar and in one of their fancy couch sections (open seating BTW) and gotten serviced pretty quickly and by some very friendly people , I had heard some mixed reviews but my experience has been Spot-On the few visits I've had with friends for happy hour or late nights, they get to you quick, bring you great refreshing & delicious cocktails with a smile , Kudos to whoever is making those things happen ..I'm a huge fan!

I also am the most sympathetic individual to restaurants due to the amount of time I spent working for wonderful establishments throughout my service career.  \n\nMy colleague and I walk into LaPaz, and there is probably 5 people in the restaurant, but it takes 5 minutes to even see a worker (who quickly looks away as she doesn't want to have to deal with us), and then another 2 minutes to be greeted.   We seat and a few minutes later, and are greeted by our server. We try and order guacamole (avocado, pico, and onion) only to be told the food preparer came in late and that would not be available.  When To  we tried to order... Tamales too would not be available.  The only two things I ever get here would not be available. \n\nMy colleague went to the men's bathroom and there were no towels, typically one could deal with a lack of towels, given the high end hand dryer.... This didn't work either.  Icing on the cake.  \n\nI hate when reviewers go on rants, and I just can't relate. So take this with a grain of salt.  My colleague and myself live for a good restaurant, and we used to love this place.  It used to be amazing, even after they moved from south blvd.

George sold me the second car and was very pleasant to work with.\n\nA week ago, I was in again and looking at trading in my TDI that I purchased from them. They offered me $4500 for a car that I purchased from them a year ago for $15k. When I expressed how I was displeased with it because the VW TDI scandal is the reason the car's value plummeted, they came back saying they could give me $9500 since I've purchased from them twice and they want to maintain that relationship. Today, I was told they could give me $4k and that the manager who told me $9500 a week ago either quit or was fired (conveniently). After some back and forth, they said $5k is the best they can do and They'd get me out the door at $39k in a vehicle on their site for $24,500. So not only do they NOT value the relationships with customers, they have proven that they do not stand behind their vehicles and definitely do not anticipate the VW \"fix\" to restore value to their vehicles. \n\nThat said, George was still pleasant to work with and kept trying to get his managers to step up and be an honorable business.

No exaggeration, within 5 minutes of meeting the salesman, he told me he's on a diet because he is in his 50's and his girlfriend is in her 30's and he gets winded f***ing her. We get in the car to take it for a drive and he starts making comments about a woman walking down the street and tells me if she's still there when we come back, I need to go back in tomorrow because he's going to go pick her up. Then as we drive past Dream Palace, he starts talking about wanting us to stop and go in. He also told me his theory is why hang out with a 5 when you can buy a 10? We get back and sit down at the computer and he had to get a manager to enter something on the computer. While the manager was sitting at the desk, the salesman proceeds to tell the manager about this woman we saw. I can't remember the word he used to describe her. The manager seemed a bit freaked out while looking over his shoulder at the young woman sitting nearby with another salesman and shushed the salesman. This salesman also had a plaque at his desk for salesperson of the year for last year.\n\nGetting back to the specific car, they got the info for my trade (I didn't have it with me, I wanted to check out their car first because of that great price and the fact that it's been there for a while and the carfax is clean). They work the numbers and come back out with the paper showing that the car WAS $19,986 NOW! $16,895 + inspection ($1,197) + prep ($695) + wheels ($2,395) (bringing the car price up to $21,182... back up above what the the market price is and more expensive than I can get the same model BRAND new - 2 years newer and 15k miles fewer) + fees. \n\nThen is the info for my trade. KBB says my trade in value is $26k, and fair market value to buy it from them is $30k. Autotrader valued the trade at $24k (there are options on the vehicle that autotrader didn't give me the choice to add). I've been shopping around and have been offered between $26k and $29k for my trade and have had other dealerships offer to buy it outright from me for between $27k and $28k.

It seemed there was a hold-up of some sort in the kitchen though because once the food started coming out, a lot of food was coming out. We had onion rings for appetizer, and it was delicious. The batter was light and crispy, and the sauces were very good.   My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium rare, and he really enjoyed it.  I was a bit boring and got the ultimate cheeseburger, medium well (since I'm pregnant and shouldn't eat anything too rare). The waitress asked if I wanted any toppings for my burger, and among other things, I requested extra pickles on my burger. When the burgers came out, it was obvious to me that the waitress wrote down that I asked for \"extra\" pickles because my burger was loaded with pickles - a good sign that she listened, and the chefs made the food as ordered. While I wished I would have ordered my burger medium, it was still quite good. The cheese flavor was quite strong, but overall, a very good burger.  Perhaps it's because I'm pregnant, but the sweet pickles were delicious - I had to ask for an extra side of pickles and actually finished all of that too. The burger was quite large for me, and after eating half of the burger, I took the buns off the other half so I can finish my dinner without overstuffing myself.  Overall, great place.

We decided on the Ultimate Variety Show on Monday afternoon and purchased our tickets via Groupon.  After purchasing, we called the reservation line to get our tickets, and were told what our seats would be.  However, upon ticket pick up, we were bumped back a few rows.  The man helping us indicated our tickets were for \"general seating\".  Yes, general seating can be rows F-O.  If I called reservation and was told my seats would be in row F, and when I come to pick up my seats, and was pushed back  to row O, what's the point of calling ahead for reservations?  No, we were not pushed back that far, but it was extremely irritating and felt like it was a cunning way of doing business.  By the way, the entire left hand section of the theater, where our original seats were supposed to be, was practically empty. \n\nThe entire process was a mess.  The 1st showing was at 7pm, and they were let out around 8:10-8:15pm.

The show was late, surprise surprise, since people were still trying to find their seats, but once the lights were out and the show started, the ushers were still walking people to their seats with very bright cell phone flashlights - very distracting. \n\nOverall, only 2, maybe 3 of the acts were worth watching, and the rest were a waste of time.

It says full-contact on their door but I'm sure you can do nothing beyond shaking hand cause I asked about the price about it. \nThe most ridiculous thing about this club was that the strippers don't take off pants!

Walked in with the kids and was not greeted with a pleasant welcoming but instead a glaring moody look from one of the stylist standing by the register( made me want to hurry and run out the door which is what I should've done). Told the guy I think his name is John that I wanted to get my son a haircut he ask me if I have anyone in particular I said no. He turned to the blond lady standing next to him the one who looked moody and uninterested that we were there to cut his hair. She seems like she didn't want to do it and was not friendly at all, especially with the kids.  I then ask if she could cut my nephew's hair too, she said no and asked someone else to cut his hair. I asked the guy and he seem uninterested to cut my nephew hair too but at least he attempted to be friendly with him. I don't understand how people who work in a place like that could be so cold and unappreciative for any businesses that I seek, but I guess your establishment can afford to be picky. I asked my son how he like his haircut, he said it was fine but the lady was rough on him and that he was scared to go back. I told him he doesn't have to worry about being scared bc we will never go back there again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Oscar (the owner) came over to the table and explained the best ways to eat it, and it was absolutely delicious! The pinto beans were whole and once again were absolutely cooked to perfection. He brought out 3 different salsas for us as well. One was the house salsa, which was the perfect blend of spice and sweet. The other was a much hotter salsa that definitely creeps up on you! It takes about 4 seconds before it tears you up! The third was a tomatillo salsa that was green. I'm not sure how to explain it but it was very good. For dessert I had the fried ice cream and it was awesome! The service was spectacular, as we were promptly seated and the food came very quickly!

Made reservations online but were able to get in 45 minutes early.  We were nervous wondering if we would get the same high quality service and food we had the first time. We were not disappointed!  Server and Maggie was attentive, friendly and helpful with menu questions. The potstickers were as good as I remembered-soft, tasty little pockets of goodness with a yummy dipping sauce. I was so excited to eat them I forgot to take a picture so my only photo was of an empty plate. Our friends tried the nachos which they loved and we also tried the brussel sprouts, which were the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  Charred but not bitter, and the sauce was full of flavor but not too spicy or sweet.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the shade and the stripside sights and sounds. We took advantage of the 4:00 happy hour prices so even the overall bill was better than expected. Tom's Urban is definitely on our \"go-to\" list when in Las Vegas.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Sail was put up but the motor was active throughout the trip. Sails were put up for display and probably for the benefits given under the Rules of the Road (kind of sleazy to do that imo). Sea chanty was weak, seen much better in Newfoundland's bars, they should really see to getting some real sea folk aboard instead of the summer highschool\/college students that seemed to run the boat.\n\nNo sun shade as before, no real activities aside from pulling a rope to hoist the main sail (which was unused). Would be a much better trip, as Mauricio A. indicated, if they actually sailed. Seems unlikely they ever will though as the day was perfect - sunny, good wind, etc. so it would have been an ideal day to do it.\n\nTrip is mostly about the company. Correction, all about the company you keep. Mine was wonderful so I didn't really care how bad the sail actually was :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

After hearing great things from fellow students, I decided to drop in to get my ears pierced. \n\nI had had my ears pierced previously, but they closed up because I never wore earrings.  It was too much of a hassle to bring my mommy in with me to get a simple piercing, so I waited until I was 18 to get the piercing done.  I went in on my birthday and upon seeing my ID, the guy at the counter wished me \"happy birthday.\"  I know that's not a big deal, but it definitely created a good vibe and little things like that in a skeptical situation can make a big difference.  \n\nThere were people still waiting to get their piercings done, so I had to wait a bit before I was shown the jewelry.  After I picked my earrings out, I had to wait even longer to be escorted into a room.  I'd say overall, the wait time was probably about an hour.  I don't think that's Blue Lotus's fault, though.  It was busy, and people had appointments, and I did not.  \n\nEventually I was taken back into a room by Myke.  He was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what was going to be done and making sure that I knew how clean the whole process was.  He washed his hands and changed his gloves numerous times and even though I'm a bit crazy about germs, I felt completely comfortable.  \n\nI turned out that my hole hadn't completely closed up, and Myke was able to just insert something through my ear the opened the hole back up.  There was a bit of pain, but nothing bad by any means.  I'm very afraid of needles, so I began to get dizzy when the first ear was done.  He kept asking me if I was okay throughout the entire process, and when I told him I was dizzy, he was extremely understanding and finished the other ear with my lying down.  After the piercings were done, he had me check in the mirror and explained to me the steps to take in the weeks to come.\n\nI didn't get a tattoo or a major piercing, but I can testify that the Blue Lotus staff, especially Myke, is professional, kind, and extremely careful about cleanliness and sanitation.  I would recommend Blue Lotus to anyone!\n\nEar piercings at Blue Lotus cost $15, but mine was only $5 because it was just reopening a previous piercing.  My earrings were Neometal with CZ and set me back $60.  It seemed a bit pricey, but I really can't judge because I haven't compared the price to other places around Madison.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":2},

(Of course I haven't had to pay the bill which was close to $400 plus tip)\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderful and is the perfect escape from the neon lights of Vegas.  Dining at Fleur de Lys makes me feel like a queen.  I love the outstanding service and the surroundings are elegant and relaxing.\n\nDuring our most recent experience the sommelier offered several suggestions to accompany our tasting menu and each was perfectly paired with the entrees.  I enjoyed a fruity Pinot Noir and had a few sips of a red, but stopped there since I'm not much of a drinker.\n\nThe food seemed to just keep coming and the only entree I passed on was the foie gras since I will not touch it for ethical reasons, but my dining companion said it was the best ever.\n  \nWe started with a mixed green salad with polenta and the Truffle Onion Soup, both excellent.  I was almost full by the time I sampled the bread basket which was amazing in itself.  I could have eaten the pretzel bread and focaccia along with the salad and soup and been very satisfied.\n\nThe other courses included a sampling of lobster and scallops, braised beef short ribs and pan seared duck breast.  My companion also ordered a sampling of Ahi Tuna Tartare.  Every course had unique flavors that worked together like an orchestra performing in my mouth.  Side dishes included white asparagus and fingerling fries.  Although I was full I couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner.  Ah, but there was a method to my madness since I was saving room for dessert.\n\nWe enjoyed a cheese sampling and fruit along with the chocolate soufflÃ© and some brittle.  \n\nI can't wait to go back this spring, hopefully with my 21 year old in tow. \nFleur de Lys is definitely on my short list of favorite restaurants.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

They were out,  was going to take about a half hour.  No problem.  Then a half hour turned to a two hours.  Threw was no white meat fried or baked chicken.  They were out of plates, ice, cups and silverware most of that time.  It's like they didn't know how to manage with a full house.  What we were able to eat was okay.

The customer service from the employees behind the counters is always going to be an experience; whether good, attentive, distracted, rude,  friendly or confused. Drivers are always friendly. I've been lucky the delivery God's  were smiling down on me because I live LITERALLY 1 block north out of their delivery area, but they still delivered!  that was awesome! Decent food (cheese bread, the bomb!), no hassle cooking, convenient and decent delivery times.  Well my luck tonight has changed, I am saddened by the loss of the delivery to my address.

But then I went to Trina's. This was very clean. \nTrina's offered a full spa pedicure with salt scrub, wax dip, callous remover, stone message and cooling gel for $40 dollars. During this time, I received a hand massage at no extra cost and as I wait for the nail polish to dry, a neck message; again no extra cost. \nThe basic charge would have been $23 if I would have kept it basic, but my much needed tired feet needed the full treatment. It was well done, was not rushed and very good treatment. \nI left with happy feet, relaxed hands and neck. It was worth the extra drive to get this treatment and well worth the price.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Everyone ordered a plate for themselves and also lots of rolls and sashimi to share. The rolls were amazing and also hugh. One of our guests has never eaten sashimi before and she loved it ( she couldn't believe raw fish can taste so good and not fishy at all). \n\nThe price was not the cheap but the food and service were very good. Our 20 something kids enjoyed it so much that they went back there a week after for more and introduced a friend to this place.\n\nWe will definitely come back.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Salad was great, and even the spines of the greens were sweet. Pizza was very nice, if different from what I'm used to. Its crust was a nice thin and crisp situation that did not get soggy at any time, thus making it better than what I got from nearby Novecento. And I'm going to say that the cheese and sauce were good but not as good as the also-nearby Montesano's Eateria - but Montesano's had a thicker, breadier crust that interfered too much with the other ingredients in my opinion.\n\nStaff were friendly, water tasted clean, and ambiance was nice. We came in during a slow time, so it wasn't busy or loud, but I can see how it would get very busy and very loud during dinner.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
