If they could just hold off, it will probably be fabulous again in about a decade as that 80s-retro-resort-glitz comes back in style.

My stay in early April was pleasant enough, but not special enough that I would stay at the property in the future or recommend it to others. \n\nPublic facilities: The main lobby and Spa Tower seem to be in better shape than the Palm Tower where my room was located. Nothing that evoked \"ooohs and aaahs\" but nice enough. There were parts of the common areas that were dated and could use updating as was apparent in the Palm Tower. One thing that another poster mentioned that I also found to be odd was the lack of any hotel staff in the Palm Tower. During my 3 night stay I think I saw someone at the desk one evening but that was it. To have to walk through the smoky casino to the main lobby to talk to a hotel staff member was just weird to me. The grounds are nicely kept and while the weather during my stay was less than desirable, the pool area looked nice, too. The parking (valet and self) is free and plentiful so if you have a rental, that's a perk.  \n\nRooms: I will say the room\/bathroom are really large. Having a foyer like entrance, large spaces, a walk in closet, seating, and a door to open to the outside (though an obstructed view)  I liked having space to spread out and a nice walk in closet to store my things (along with a safe). The bed was a bit on the lumpy side though and I did find is difficult to get comfortable. The bathroom Jacuzzi tub was nice and I liked the layout, counter space, and robes too. The one thing that I found strange was the lack of a place to put things in the shower. Strange to have no shelf so I just put my bottles on the floor of the shower.\n\nOnsite restaurants\/room service: While staying on property I tried the Promenade Cafe for lunch (sub par), Irish Pub for drinks\/apps (decent), Starbucks for morning coffee (good), and room service for breakfast (good). Nothing stands out as being amazing but it was definitely nice to have a coffee option. The fees associated with room service seemed higher than most places I have stayed recently but it was a treat and provided me with a nice chunk of \"me\" time. \n\nSpa: See review on Spa Aquae's Yelp page. \n\nLocation: Yes it's 20 minutes to the Strip but for someone who has already stayed on the Strip in the past, I don't feel like I missed out at all. It's actually nice being on the outskirts and seeing the views around the hotel was a pleasant experience. I did have a rental car so I was able to come and go as I pleased and not have to rely on any taxis or shuttle services. \n\nBottom line: Would I stay again? Probably not. There are so many other places to stay in the area that I would want to try someplace new and more updated for the price you pay.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I work in the restaurant industry so it usually takes a lot of wrongs for me to think service sucks. Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen. I guess my problem is if you're that slow there's no excuse for poor service which is exactly what I felt I received. \nTo be honest this location is 3 minutes from my house, but I'd rather drive further to the Tropicana location for better service and food.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They finally started to send me my bill in the mail so I could see it and pay it. Now, I can't access Contour online for the same reason; I can't login..... and there's more. The Contour voice command seldom works unless you unplug the box and let it reset. The whole system will shut down at anytime, reboot itself, and come back on. It will also freeze and do the same thing. Coming back on can take 5, 10, 15 minutes, whatever. They also require you to have a landline to get a lower price. I have a landline that I have no use for - I don't even know what the number is and there is no telephone attached to it - because I got a lower price if I took it. I have shown the tech guys - who show up every now and then -  features they were unaware of. I could relate lots of stories of bumbling, ineptness, and just plain old \"they don't have a clue about what what's going on.\" But, there is something that I do like. The illuminated remote control!  I'll be switching soon - probably to DirectTV for television service and LV.net for internet service. I know that both provide better service than Cox.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Decided to start to post due to the disappointment with this restaurant. \n\nGot the $50 prefix menu, also used the Costco gift certs... so definitely a great great value. Value:5 Star \n\nLocation: Just plain weird, had to triple check the address on the navi to make sure we arrived at the right location. Location: 2 star \n\nDecor: No bad.. not great, although the open kitchen was both a plus and minus. Very interactive and fun with the... but the smell of the grill and some of the seafood was just overwhelming at certain times. Our clothing smelled semi-fishy from sitting at a table so close to the kitchen. \nDecor\/layout: 3 star. \n\nFood: Major bummer. Let me just say, I never had rosemary's, I got nothing against them. Perhaps my expectation was too high... the food just didn't do it for me. \n\n-Hugo's BBQ shrimp and blue cheese slaw: Too salty, over cooked stiff shrimp. \n-Duo tar tar: Nicely done \n-Scallops and the Halibut were the best dishes of the night. Very Good \n-Meats were a major disappointment. \nThe Veal Porter house was very tender but tasteless, very salty on the outside, but very bland on the inside. \nRack of lamb were not bad, but not great either, portions were very small too. \nFor dessert, we got the chocolate cream pie (very good), apple tart (very good), Bread pudding (super bad.... tasted like a doughy sponge... no we didn't finish it) and banana cheese cake (way too sweet). Over all food: 3 Star \n\nService: Wonderful. We didn't have the heart to complain about the less than stellar taste to such wonder servers. \n\nOver all Rosemary's is not a bad restaurant, but I don't think it deserves the 4.5 star rating on yelp. Maybe they just had a off night, maybe my expectations were to high. We're from Calif, having to convince my wife and in laws to drive off the strip to eat at a 4.5 yelped restaurant for some delicious fine dinning... we were disappointed.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Matt Melone was incredible and his manager Mike Jameson too.  \n\nI flew to Arizona from Colorado to purchase a used Toyota Tacoma truck from Matt Melone.  Matt picked me up from the airport in the new truck.  It was a warm day and when I went to put up the air conditioner, it didn't function properly, it just blew air.   Immediately upon getting back to the dealership everyone went into high gear to fix the problem.  Matt took me to go get something to eat, and took care of the bill.  They ended up replacing a whole part, which couldn't be done until the following day, but they paid for a hotel room for me and offered to pay any expenses I might have, and they made sure I had breakfast.  They also provided me with a loaner car.   They even went so far as to pay for my hotel room in Flagstaff and offered to pay for my dinner too, that next night on my way back to Colorado.  They also reduced the purchase price to help us even further!  The reduction helped pay for my plane ticket out there, which was a wonderful and exceptionally thoughtful consideration.\n\nThey truly bent over backwards for me, and what could have been a complete nightmare, they did everything in their power to make it not so.   I saw that this dealership has had negative reviews in the past.  I asked Matt about this and he said that they have let go of everyone from the top to the down that was responsible for the poor running of the dealership.  New people have been brought in and they are determined to make this a great dealership.  This was exceedingly evident.\n\nWe need to get another car in the next few months, and we will be calling Matt Melone to help us find one.  It would be a pleasure to work with them again.  Thank you Camelback Ford!  Happy New Year!  \n\nWarm regards, \nAnn Brumby","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Slow to get in even when there's plenty of seating available.  Very Spotty service. Now that they raised prices (most expensive buffet on strip that I've gone to), I won't return.  Back to Bellagio which is now cheaper.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1},

There is no Thai place in either town that compares to this one. Tofu pad Thai makes being vegetarian worth it and picking your spicy level (1-10, 6 for me) is awesome. Authentic food for suThe lunch special is cheaper than Panda and a million times better. The service is not perky but that's part of the charm. Very small seating area and not much to look at, but get past that because you will love it! This will always be on my Vegas to do list when I return.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Pancakes were dense and not hot.  Strange setup with seating right on top of each other. I actually think Denny's has better pancakes than these.  Sorry, I really wanted to like it.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Red beans and rice is phenomenal. The fries are absolutely the best anywhere, super crispy and actual potatoes! This is definitely a great little piece of New Orleans in Las Vegas and a welcome independent experience in Summerlin.  Everyone should try this place!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The ingredients all are good quality and it's cooked east coast style, so the crust is not too thick or thin.  Couple of other New York style places on the far west side in Summerlin, but this one is definitely better.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.  Also, the girl who took my order was friendly and competent and the delivery guy was courteous and friendly.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}]
