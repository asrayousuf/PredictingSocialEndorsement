We did not take so much time to ask for our lunch. The restaurant seems clean and not messy.\nOne big point for this restaurant was that we did not need to wait so much for our food to be ready. Something that happens a lot of times with the so called \"fast-food\" restaurants. Because the court was crowded, it was hard to find a seat for us. We needed to spend some time to find a seat. This time I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and fries.\nOverall, the experience was nothing special. Not bad neither fantastic. Just the good feeling when you leave a \"fast-food\" restaurant that knows what they are doing. The fries were not greasy and the sub was tasteful.

Yes\nIs it good choice for big groups? Yes\nIs the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No\n\nOn Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.\n\nThe table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.\n\nOverall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other. There are a plenty around the Greater Toronto Area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Try Jalisco's up on Durango and near the 215. Worth the drive and has authentic flavor.

And while I looked thru one of the servers pointed out to me that the daily and lunch specials on the back of the menu.  And on that same page I notice they also put \"15% off. For any purchase with us! Cash only. Expiry date will be informed in advance\".   The food was okay, not great. And so when they gave me the bill I asked for the 15% off as I will pay cash.  The server then told me that the discount special does not apply to the daily and lunch specials. I asked if it is expired they did not say so before \"in advance\". She said \"no\" it does not apply to the specials. WHAT!!! The same specials that is printed on the same page just above the 15% off notice does not apply.  I pointed out to them that it does not say that on the menu. So I just paid my bill and walked out. Not worth arguing over the stupidness of how they plan their printing as I do not plan to return to this place.   How do I add a picture to this review so you can see their menu.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":0},

At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  \n\nEvery boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  \n\nOne of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  \n\nBottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.  And that's what you'll get at GAP fitness.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We ordered some extra stuff because of this just so they did not lose money on us. Their kindness payed off with good karma. \n    We have been back several times and had sushi rolls.  However, my husband does not like seaweed so ask the rolls to be made with soy paper instead.  They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service. \n     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.  Now they do limit the sashimi to 4 slices of each type of fish but no limit on rolls or nigiri and furthermore it includes for no additional charge some appetizers and drink options as well which makes it a nice experience.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.

It delivers the WOW!-factor with all the Cirque-type amazing aqua-acrobatics, and keeps you entertained the whole way through. Seriously, the performers were doing twists & turns & jumps & moves I didn't even know  was humanly possible. The diving segment was my favorite. Hats off to all the amazing performers!! \n\nA little tip about the seating..... The venue is an intimate circular theater, with the circular pool in the center as it's stage. There are only 12 rows of seating, so yes, basically every seat has a great view & you really can't go wrong. The first 2 rows are considered \"splash zone\" ($105\/seat), the next 9 rows (Rows 3-11) are Premium seats ($129\/seat) and the last row (Row 12) is the VIP\/Dream seats (ranging from $155 to $195\/seat.).  I have sat in the 1st row (splash) and 5th row (premium) and can honestly say I much preferred the premium row. I'm not discouraging the splash zone seats because of the threat of getting wet.... In fact, I only got a sprinkle of water while in the first row (if even that)! The reason I suggest the premium section is because this show has SO much to see and by sitting a bit further back, you'll be able to take in more visually.  There is also a lot of the acts happening high up (way high up, from the ceiling).... and I found myself straining my neck to see all that was going on up high, whereas you could view it all at ease sans the neck strain if you were in premium:)  Also, I don't think it's worth it to get the VIP\/Dream seats.... other than it offering a super plushy comfy chair (and champagne & choco covered strawberries) , one of the perks to those seats is that it includes a video monitor in front the seat, which I heard is streaming you live feed of all the backstage and underwater action during the show, but believe me, you'll have so much to watch on stage, I don't think you want to waste your time watching the monitor ;)","useful":12,"funny":2,"cool":2},

It's moving. It's captivating. You will leave the show with a huge smile on your face, a hop & skip in your step, and you will NOT be able to stop humming all the fabulous songs in your head for days! \n\nJust a few of the HITS that will get stuck in your head: \n- Sherry\n- Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\n- Big Girls Don't Cry\n- Who Loves You\n- Oh What a Night! December 1963\n- Walk Like a Man\n- Bye Bye Baby\n- I've Got You Under My Skin\n\nQuick tidbit on seating:\nJB has been at \"Paris Theater\" since March 2012. It's a bigger stage & venue than when it was at Palazzo (where it reigned from 2008 thru 2011). Other than size, another difference is that this new theater does not have a balcony. You are either in the front half (Orchestra section), or back half (Mezzanine). When I got my tix, I was told that the last row (Row M) was only 75 feet away from the stage, implying that even the last row has a good view of the stage. I ended up getting seats in Row K (third row from the back), and they were right! You still have a great view of everything. :)\n\nI've seen JB twice, and can't wait to see it again!!!!!","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  \n\nFirst, a few fun facts:\n- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 \n- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! \n- The NOBU Hotel, a \"boutique hotel\" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first \"NOBU Hotel\" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  \n\nNow, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.\n\nNow, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!\n\n1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)\nsix (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking \"should I order another round now or later?\" as they are finishing off this one ;) \n\n2) Black Cod w\/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)\nSo succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't \"pass\" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) \n\n3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)\nThis comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, \"las vegas\", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their \"own\" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! \n\n4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)\nOK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. \n\n5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16\nThis was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... \n\n6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14\nIf you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!\n\nDessert\nWe went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15\nFlourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. \n\nI'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!","useful":20,"funny":1,"cool":11},

I didn't see it available on their lunch menu :( \n- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - so delish! especially if you like goat cheese & mushrooms.

My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) \n- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce!

Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op\n- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer\n\nOverall, it was so delicious.

Restaurant Groupons are something of a scam.  I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.\n\nI was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).\n\nThe food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp\/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples\/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.  \n\nThat second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.

The birthday singing thing is kitsch, and pretty annoying because it happens so frequently (6 times my last visit), but the food at Pantheon is really good.  I have been twice and have not been disappointed.  The dips combo plate is amazing, though I would ask to switch out the Taramosalata if you don't like caviar, which is too fishy for my taste.  Their pita is fantastic, and their seafood is out of this world.  Saganaki amazing, horiatiki is not the best on the strip, but passable.  3 people ate and had an alcoholic bev for $90, and had leftovers for another meal.  If you're hunting for the most authentic Greek food on the Danforth, you could do a whole lot worse.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The portions were awesome, and the value to quality ratio was off the charts.  Clean stylish restaurant, and some really righteous patrons.  I'm talking almost once a week visits, sinking almost $500 into this place over three years.\n\n...unfortunately there are new owners or something is going on as my last few visits I've observed a discernible downtrend in the portion sizes, and the prices have all been upped.  No longer can I get my 3 pc biftekia and chicken gyro with zucchini fries for $14 - it now comes out to over $20.  That's insane inflation for a standard pricehike and coupled with smaller portions does not make me a happy customer.  I had recruited a small army of people to repeatedly go here for Greek but will now need to find a new place that values the customer experience in true Greek fashion.\n\nIf you do go, by the love of all that is holy - get the zucchini fries.

When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. \n\nEver since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.\n\nAs per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price\/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.\n\nThe cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? \n\nOn food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I only went the one time so I'm not telling you you need to get those things, but you certainly won't be disappointed if you do.\n\nAmbiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: \"this song is about me!\" or \"I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME?\" or \"Tamara is a super betch\" or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.\n\nWe had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.
