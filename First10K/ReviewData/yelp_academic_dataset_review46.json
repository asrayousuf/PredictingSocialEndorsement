The service was some of the worst I have ever encountered. From the wait staff and the manager. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are one of three tables in the whole restaurant. \n10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our existence.\nOur drinks come, we order: An appetizer, A pasta dish and A pizza dish.\n10 minutes later, our waitress comes by to inform us that they are out of the appetizer we ordered. We are given a menu to pick a new item, along with a very pathetic and half -assed apology. \nAnother 10 minutes go by before our waitress reappears in the dining room to ask us our new appetizer order. (Where on earth she was for 10 minutes is a mystery.) At this point, we express our annoyance that we don't want an appetizer that is going to come out after the meal. \n(Little did we know that the food would take forever). \n\nThe manager brings our food out. That was appreciated until he opens his mouth and gives an awkward sorry and blames the kitchen for not telling them about the appetizer situation. \n\nMy boyfriend eats about 1\/3 or his meal then looks at his pasta... it looks like it's missing something. It's a taco or nacho pasta or something. It had never come with the toppings. \nWe inform the waitress, who seems stunned and asks us if we want more toppings. \nI try to explain that his dinner never came with the toppings. She still doesn't get it and asks us again if we just want her to get us some \"more\" toppings. \nAnnoyed we agree and she brings them out in little containers with lids on them and plops them in front of us with a half-assed sorry. \n\nWe eat our bland, greasy food. Then we wait 15 minutes for our waitress to resurface to ask her for our bill. We pay, we leave.  \n\nMy boyfriend contacts the GM of this Boston Pizza location. He gets a response where the GM blames the manager and the waitress for being incompetent and offers us $20.00. \n\nMaybe I'm a hard audience, but $20.00 for an experience this horrible is insulting.     \n\nGoing to stick with Jack Astor's or East Side Mario's, or any other chain restaurant. At least if they screw up THEIR shitty food, they know how to treat their customers with respect.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Bruschetta was stone cold , and did not taste fresh at all. I also ordered their classic hot wings which the waiter said were really spicy. Adding vineger to give the illusion of spicyness is an insult to chicken wings, and on top of that the other flavours were completely non-existent. The four cheese spinach dip with deep fried chips tasted like it was microwaved, and it looked caked and dehydrated around the corners of the bowl. \n\nService: Quick and cheerful.\n\nOverall: Would not visit this Kelsey's again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Received it medium-rare. Delicious, except it could have used less salt as it overpowered most of the other flavours. Sad to see a prime cut go to waste because of over salting; therefore it was not worth the price paid. The wild Irish salmon was overcooked, but the flavour was exceptional.  The lobster and ravioli lacked any noticeable flavour, it was bland and the saffron sauce could have been reduced further. \n\nService: A bit slow, considering it wasn't fully booked. Servers looked like they were running around with their hair on fire. They could have been more hospitable. Hostesses were cheerful and inviting.\n\nOverall: In such a competitive area for fine dining, I expected more from Micheal's. Amazing decor, warm atmosphere, but it felt as if the chef did not care for the things coming out of the kitchen. The one thing you don't do is send out food over\/undercooked, especially in a restaurant of this caliber. Because of this, I will not be dining here again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My best suggestion is to ignore any of the things that it is trying to be, it is not a particularly great restaurant but it is an awesome bar for the beer lover, and the appetisers are definitely adequate for an accompaniment to the beer.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I can't say that it made a huge difference to me because the beer food and service are the real selling points. Though, they are admittedly swamped on wing nights, which negatively effects the service on the whole the bartenders there are awesome, and give you the feel that you are a regular with even a somewhat regular attendance.

I'm a lover of BWW and this location is right by my work so me & my coworkers order out of here almost every week. Customer service is usually just okay, better when you actually go in, sit down and eat, especially in the bar. Today I placed 3 separate orders over the phone. When I arrived, they forgot part of the first order so I had to wait there for them to make it, in the middle of my work day. When I got back to work, we found I was shorted a ranch that I had paid for, and my coworker found that his wing order was short about 5 wings so we called in and spoke with a helpful manager, Daniel, who offered to remake the order. \n\nMy coworker went back to the BWW to pick up his order and, when he asked for the ranch that they had forgotten, they refused to give it to him because it wasn't on that receipt.  Lol  are you kidding me? He mentioned it was on a separate order and they really wouldn't give him one side of ranch valued under a dollar. At this point it became laughably bad to just about everyone in our office. \n\nThere are plenty of other BWW locations around the valley with awesome servers & hosts who treat customers as they should be treated, unlike this one. If you feel like wings but don't want to waste your time & money at this location, just go to the one on Durange since they're always great.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

There are well-placed tables and chairs where you can leave your swatches while you browse, then come back to sit down and calculate yardages.\n\nThere was a wide range of fabric qualities\/prices and I agree with other reviewers that their prices do seem to be lower than other fabric stores in the city.  Part and parcel of this is a no return policy, a 1\/2 yard minimum and some restrictions about how much they will leave on a bolt.

In fact, my favorite server from Sweet Lulu on Queen West turned up at the Adelaide Street location.  He is wonderful.  And the servers really know the menu, including the wine list. I've always been impressed. \n\nI live just around the corner from Terroni on Queen and I always marvel at the line-ups when there are so many other good choices within a few blocks.  I end up there every once in a while because friends want to go, or because we want to go somewhere kid friendly with our two year old.  I have to hand it to them--they are really accommodating of kids.  They don't bat an eyelash when you come in with a stroller and ask for a high chair.  The only rudeness I've experienced is from the patrons waiting in line, who seem really put out when they need to move six inches so I can get out the door.  \n\nThe food has always been good, sometimes fantastic.  I've never had anything terrible, but last night I had a just ok dish for the first time: the spaghetti alla norma.

I started with the giuggiolosa salad, which was wonderful and kept the meal from being a loss.  \n\nThe pizzas are really tasty, and the spaghetti with lemon and capers is one of my favorites.  The pasta portions are pretty small for the money, I find.  They are just the right size, if you ask me, compared to the monstrous portions at other places, but $16 or so for a small portion of vegetarian pasta seems excessive to me.  \n\nMy biggest peeve is that the salads are all just shy of entree size, which means too large to be starters, but at entree salad prices.  It feels indulgent (and it is expensive) to get a salad and a pasta, but pasta alone isn't enough veg for me, and a salad alone isn't filling enough.\n\nActually, that's my second biggest pet peeve.  My biggest is the little note on the menu that says, \"While alterations may seem easily accommodated they compromise the unique characteristics of our food.

So instead of dinner at Nota Bene, we signed 10 documents in triplicate at Bloor and Ossington, then wandered, starving, into the first place we saw that looked interesting. \n\nIt's definitely not fair to compare Queen of Sheba to Nota Bene, but in comparing it to other Ethiopian places I've eaten, in Toronto and elsewhere, it's really not in the same ballpark.  \n\nDo you want the good news or the bad news first?  Read bottom to top if you're a good news first kind of person.  \n\nThe decor and cleanliness were really, really sketchy.  My husband and I (who were in a surprisingly good mood given the turn of events) commented that had it not been for fairly significant dining experiences in various developing countries, we would have high-tailed it out of there.  Just inside the front door we were greeted with the stale smell of cigarettes and just damp dirtiness; fortunately as we passed the kitchen and entered the dining room the smell greatly improved.  The carpeted(!) dining room was sorely in need of a shampoo.  The bathrooms were freezing cold and let's just say not spotless.  The paint in the dining room looked half-finished, with roller marks on the ceiling and some unfortunate color choices, and patches just not finished, like the painter quit half way through the job.  One upshot was the lighting, which was mostly from wall sconces pointing upward (not bad when ceiling mounted neon lights would have fit right in with the rest of the decor choices).\n\nThe service.  Oh God the service. She was pleasant but either really ditsy or really high.  My husband asked what the premium beers mentioned on the menu were and she just shrugged and said she didn't know.  In a  nice way, though.  When we told her we don't eat red meat and asked if we could do a platter that was a mix of chicken and veg she seemed sort of confused.  She suggested we do the mixed platter, but minus the beef and lamb, about which I sought to confirm that that might mean more chicken and veg given the absence of the other items.  To which she responded, nicely, no.  Being hungry and in no mood to be difficult, we just ordered the mixed platter of chicken, beef, lamb and vegetables, and I proceeded to eat red meat for the first time in 18 months. \n\nThe food was ok.  The beef was actually a highlight.  It was stewed in a dark sauce with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was two drum sticks in a spicy sauce and the meat was tender and flavorful.  The lamb was nice as well, though the tender meat was done a disservice by a not very flavorful sauce.  The three vegetable dishes, a split pea, a lentil and a cabbage dish, were disappointingly bland (they made me glad we hadn't gone for the vegetarian platter).  And finally, the side plate of injera was right out of the refrigerator.  That sucked, actually.\n\nThe best thing I can say is that the price was right.  For a huge platter of food for two plus three beers it was $40 plus tip.  That's a pretty good savings versus what we would have spent at Nota Bene...","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1},

It was clear in my questioning of the server that their sauces come in cans\/bottles\/vats because there was no chance of adjusting spiciness.  Her advice was to stick to something with no \"chili pepper\" symbol next to it.  Fair enough.  So I ordered ginger chicken.  The saving grace was that the chicken appeared to be white meat and the veggies were fresh, but it was exceptionally bland.  No hint of ginger, not even any salt.  Just a corn-starch thickened sauce (sauce being a generous word for the gelatanous film covering my food).\n\nOne of my fellow diners has a bad reaction to MSG, and without recapping the whole conversation it was clear there could be no guarantees about the omission of MSG from any meal.  No report back from my companion on her post-meal MSG status, but she commented that her dish was quite dry and bland.  That explains all the dipping in soy sauce.\n\nThai cooking is known for its balance of flavors--a mix of savory, sweet, sour, salty.  The mango salad, which is typically sweet and sour with some vinegar, was pretty much just sweet.  It wasn't awful, just not good.\n\nThe service was good and accommodating.  My toddler made the usual mess, and I did the usual hands-and-knees routine to make sure toddlers remain welcome in restaurants, and the server was super nice in insisting she would take care of it.  \n\nIt's definitely the kind of place that has a cook, not a chef, in the kitchen.

I chose a wine from Chinon, mentioning to my friends that I had spent time time there on vacation, and our server mentioned that that is where \"we\" are from, which I took to mean the proprietors.  Chinon is a small town in the Loire Valley, thus the restaurant's name.\n\nI had chicken liver pate, which I knew would be rich, but nothing could have prepared me for the melt in your mouth beauty of this particular plate.  And it was a massive portion.  Two sort of gelato-scoop curls, which I shared with my companions.  Said companions were my husband's work colleagues, so they were shy about sharing, but the tastiness of the pate had some of them coming back for second and third tastes, propriety be damned.  Even so, some of it went uneaten it was so insanely, devlishly rich.  \n\nMy main was salmon, which was served on what looked like stir-fried rice, as in what you'd get in a cardboard container from a Chinese takeout joint.  It didn't look especially appealing but I had high hopes, expecting that a French take on fried rice might be tasty.  Alas, it was a bit boring and a bit too salty.  The salmon, however, was fabulous.  \n\nAfter my pate starter I opted out of dessert but my companions raved about theirs.  \n\nI would definitely go back, for the interesting wine list (interesting French and non-French options, interesting and non-interesting prices), wonderful food, good service and lovely atmosphere.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2},

I went for my anniversary last night and it hit the spot.  The host was lovely and seated us right away.  We were twenty minutes late and he wasn't bothered in the least.  Told us we did him a favor since the reservation before us lingered.  \n\nWe eat meat occasionally but ended up ordering entirely from the vegetarian menu.  I had the mushroom salad which was wonderful.  My husband had the gnocchi, which I was jealous of and if I had a longer arm I would have eaten half of.  My main was the tortelloni and my husband's the tortiere.  Both were delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.  \n\nThe Bellwoods Brewery beer from just down the road was nice and the wines by the glass were interesting.  4 oz pours may not seem like a bargain at $9 - $15 or more, but I guess the alternative is to make it 5oz pours and jack up the price by 25%.  \n\nWe got the dessert board for two, which I feared might just be a bunch of fancy sweets prepped earlier in the day by a pastry chef who was long gone by evening.  Turns out it was, but that was ok.  The madeleines were lemony with a little crispness around the edges.  A square of nougat was chewy and nutty.  \n\nThe vibe was lively though not too loud.  As luck would have it they played one of my favorite albums of all time during the second half of our dinner.  \n\nI read a lot of other reviews and my assessment is that Woodlot is a victim of its own success.  People love to find a reason to take down really popular and trendy places so they can feel good about their superior discernment.  Don't be fooled.  This is one of the best casual restaurants in Toronto and it deserves five stars on Yelp.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2},

It was packed from the start but it lives up to the hype and I have never been disappointed.  I stopped by with some friends from out of town after a visit to the CN Tower and it was a nice counterbalance to the touristy scene, being all full of downtown hipsters without a tourist in sight. \n\nIt was a Friday smack in the middle of the lunch rush but we got a table in about ten minutes.  The entire staff was tremendous, which alas is not all that common at popular hangouts with frequent 30-60 minute waits.  They can get a little uppity (and a little run ragged), but not here.\n\nThe kicker is that I was with my 5 year old daughter and 1 1\/2 year old son and the staff didn't flinch.  We are not their usual target audience but they brought us a high chair and generally worked around our noise and mess (my kids are not new to restaurants so aren't a total terror but still... they're kids).  \n\nI guess I should say something about the food.  I usually hate to order pad thai since it's sort of a cliche, but it's just so good I can't help myself.  And the combo is wicked and well worth the extra three bucks.

The butter chicken was really average.  Nothing special at all, and it would not get me to go back.  The saag paneer was kind of brothy, rather than creamy, which I'm willing to chalk up to a style difference, however it was so salty it was barely edible (and I like salt a lot).\n\nThe small veggie side dishes (we had beets, eggplant and lentils) were a highlight and the naan was fantastic.  The chai was delicious but too sweet for my taste.\n\nThe main dining room space is nice and casual.  Maybe 10 tables.  There's a good size patio that I imagine is lovely in the summer.  There are two very cute two-person tables upstairs nestled in a dormer window, however I can't imagine sitting up there as you are bombarded with the aggressive, sickly sweet smell of the bathroom air freshener, and one of the seats looks directly at the urinal in the men's washroom (the door seems to be at rest in the open position when the washroom is not in use).\n\nThe service was fine and the kitchen was fast.  No complaints at all there.  It was fairly kid-friendly, although they do not have a high chair.  \n\nI've had much, much better Indian food in Toronto.

Helpful and knowledgeable with none of the grumpiness you might expect from people who sit behind bullet-proof glass and help people navigate through complicated exercises in paperwork.\n\nI am American and was going to file a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  Your experience may be different if you are going to apply for a visa to visit the U.S. The line was definitely longer for visas, and as one reviewer notes, if it's busy you may very well spend time waiting outside.\n\nA couple of things could be improved:\n\n1. The list of things you can't bring inside that's posted on the web site is different from the one posted outside the building where you get in line.  The web site specifically says no cell phones, but in fact they will allow you to check a cell phone at security and pick it up when you're done.  The web site doesn't say anything about large purses or backpacks, but the sign outside says they are prohibited (although they did let me bring in my backpack full of art supplies to keep my five year old occupied while we waited).  I should have snapped a photo of the poster outside that lists prohibited items.  It's plainly visible from the street if you want to have a look in advance.\n\n2. They have an interesting interpretation of the word \"appointment.\"  It doesn't mean come at a certain pre-agreed time and someone will see you at that time give or take a few minutes like it does in the rest of the world.  It means come at that time, take a number, and depending on how busy we are we will call you in 1-2 hours. \n\nTip: don't kill yourself getting your Express Post envelope before your appointment.  You can duck out to the Staples across the street to get it while you're waiting for your number to be called.  Just make sure you get a slip of paper giving you permission to re-enter without waiting in line again.","useful":24,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I don't say this lightly; there's a lot that needs to go right in order to produce something more than the oily, thick-battered fare you're likely to find in most Calgary pubs. Their fish is fresh (the place is primarily a fish market - one of the few in the city) , their cut is ample, their batter is thin, tasty, and just a little bit crunchy. A coating of house-made tartar sauce on each flaky piece seals the deal. The accompanying fries are fine, but are typically not made to order (unlike the fish), so they can vary from fryer-fresh to a limp, luke-warm.\n\nThere's more to the menu than fried fish but I was disappointed with their bland fish tacos and their cheese-rich-but-fish-poor tuna melt.  The seafood chowder is hearty and better than most at this price-level, but the quality can vary. They clearly know their fried fish, however, and I've never been disappointed with either their cod or halibut offerings.

And if that's all you're looking for, Marathon will not disappoint.\n\nIf you're like me, however, and expect good, African flavour for your money, I suggest you look elsewhere. The stews - I had their staple beef, chicken, lamb, and chickpea stews  - are all fairly uninteresting, many of them rich in the flavour of their tomato base and little else. If it hadn't been for the somewhat smokey lamb, I'd liken the experience to eating pasta with tomato sauce at a cheap Italian chain restaurant.  For what you are paying - e.g.: $18\/person if you do the dinner combo platter - the serving sizes are quite small and though the injera is plentiful, it is too bland to eat on its own. \n\nIt's unfortunate because there are not many options for Ethiopian\/Eritrean food in the city. Perhaps the demand just isn't there. But I can't help but wonder if Marathon's lack-luster (and expensive!) execution of the genre may be partly to blame.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Crossing from the city sidewalk into the front yard you feel as if you've stumbled across a cool, but low-key house party in the middle of the suburbs. The main floor is as small as it is cozy, with old wood floors, a stairway that belongs in an old farm house, and calming, earthy tones throughout. Other than the balcony - which you'll have trouble procuring unless you come early - the 2nd story is far less interesting and not much different than your typical low-rent city bar.\n\nIf you can find a seat, you'll need to save it somehow and order from the bar.  The minimally renovated kitchen means your food options ($$) are limited (nachos or pizza - both of which good, not great) and potentially time intensive (expect at least a 45 minute wait if the bar is remotely full). The beer selection is excellent but glasses of their craft varieties (including their house beer) are typically more than $8 each. The cost is offset partly by the higher alcohol content, but unless you're an expert at nursing a beer, it is difficult to enjoy an evening of any appreciable length without ruining your wallet. As long as you're in it for unique beer in a unique place, it might just be worth it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2},

I have recommended this hotel to several friends who are looking for a place to stay when taking their kids to Carowinds.. \n\nAfter this last stay, I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AGAIN.\n\nok, so here is what happened. We checked in Friday afternoon, took our things to the room, changed our clothes and headed to the park for some fun.. came back around 8 p.m. and noticed our T.V. was not working.. A fine gentlemen came up tried to fix it, could not fix it, and got us a new room.. not an issue, he was prompt polite, and solved the issue quickly, switching the room was not a problem.\n\nSaturday get up, eat some breakfast, return to the room, knock on the door, it was housekeeping, i told them we would leave the room around 10, she asked if we needed service, i said yes please, just please make the beds, and new towels and amenities in the bathroom that would be great, and off to the Water Park we went.. \n\nWe came back around 2:30, room was not done by housekeeping, but we knew that someone had been in the room, because the TV channel had changed from the kids programming.. My wife wanted to take a shower so she went down to the front desk to get some towels, and was told to find housekeeping.. She asked why our room was not done, and was told housekeeping does new checkins first, and then does stay-overs second.. This sounds a little backward to me but ok.. our room was not done..\n\nNext we put our kids down for naps, since we were going to go back to the park that evening.. Our kids could not nap because housekeeping kept yelling up and down the hallway.. I asked several times for them to please be quite, and was completely ignored. I tried to call the front desk, but the phone did not work, so I went down to the front desk, and yes i was a little upset, I asked to speak with management and was told she was management, I explained the situation and was told that there was a Family Reunion in town and that was where the noise was coming from. I stated no, this was housekeeping. she proceeded to argue with me on who was causing the noise. I said I wanted to speak to the owner, she gave me an 800 number to call, I returned to my room, and called the 800# and was on hold for 20 minutes. \n\nThen for the next hour there was 4 knocks on the door, when i opened the door, there was no one there, but the housekeepers cart was right next door.. I figured it was payback for complaining. Our room never was cleaned, my children were unable to take naps, no apology was ever given.  \n\nI have to add that they did refund $27 of my $150 bill, apparently this is the appropriate refund when your room does not get serviced, you do not have any amenities, you have continuous arguments with their employees and management, and they do not let your kids nap.\n\nWE ARE DONE WITH CHOICE HOTELS, AND WILL NEVER STAY OR RECOMMEND CHOICE HOTELS AGAIN!!!!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

If it hadn't been for that, I would have never even thought to eat at this place.  This was everything you would expect from a high-end restaurant: beautiful decor, ambiance, superior service.  I was extremely impressed that when the dining room doors were closed, you absolutely cannot hear any of the noise from the casino floor.  Quite the feat considering when were were there the table dancers were performing less than 50 steps away from the entrance to the restaurant.\n\nWe started with the escargot.  It was incredibly fantastic.  I'd had escargot before and it was always my experience that they were a little bit chewy, so that is what I expected.  That was completely not the case here.  They were warm. soft, tender, buttery, and just enough garlic to get a really good flavor but it didn't punch you in the mouth or send you running for the mouthwash.\n\nFor our entrees my boyfriend had the sauteed green-peppercorn filet of beef and I had the pan seared duck breast and duck sausage.  On my first bite I just melted.  Gave out and audible \"mmmmmm\" complete with an eyeroll....and again with the second bite....and again with the third....then I cut into the sausage and I nearly fell out of the booth.  Every bite was pure heaven.  I think my boyfriend was pretty sure he was going to have to take my upstairs for a smoke afterward!  I have never had duck so perfectly cooked.  Tender, juicy, and so full of flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend was enjoying the same out of his steak.  He sacrilegiously ordered the steak \"medium\", which in my opinion instantly kills the flavor of the meat.  However it was so wonderfully seasoned that there was zero compromise in the flavor and so perfectly cooked that I'm pretty sure it could have been cut with a spork!\n\nFor dessert we decided on the pistachio souffle with white chocolate sauce.  Completely fluffy, moist, sweet goodness in a bowl.  It stood beautifully and there was a wonderful crisp crunch to the outside, and oh-so-soft, warm, and melted inside.  The last bite where the white chocolate sauce had fused with and melted into the remains of the souffle was complete perfection.\n\nNormally I would scoff at dropping this much coin on a single meal, but this place is now going to be built into the Vegas budget.

Explained all of the feathers that it had on it then took us for a test ride.  There was no pressure to buy or not to buy.  Gave me a great deal on my trade in.

The food was ok but not \"omg! This is so awesome!\".  It was late so I think we got lucky with street parking, but that could be an issue if you came at regular hours.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Crispy beef is soggy with no flavour at all, the lettuce and bean sprouts in our vermicelli were all brown and rotten, pad thai is awful not an ounce of flavour and i'm pretty sure they don't know what thai style curries are because that is not what I was served at all. We will not order from here again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
