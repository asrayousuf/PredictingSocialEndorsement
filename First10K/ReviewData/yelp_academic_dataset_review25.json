It wasn't where I expected to find it; sandwiched between a TJ Maxx and a Marshalls, but it lived up to the reviews.  Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.  No one was super starving, so we skipped on appetizers.  Solid beer selection which pleased our group.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes.  One person ordered the granddad.  Holy booze - this shake was delicious, but there big and strong so be careful!!\n\nBURGERs:  You can choose from organic, free range beef, bison, chicken breast or a veggie burger for all of the burgers.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, so when I go all in when I get a burger!  Two of us got the Monty; peppercorn rub, horseradish cheese with a Cabernet sauce and onions... SO GOOD.  Ordered medium rare and they were perfect.  Other side of the table did the custom burgers and they were extremely happy as well.  Burgers come with homemade potato chips, but you can also substitute fries and coleslaw too.  Chips were great, and the fries were good too (they had some kind of rosemary seasoning).  By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.  Service was great too!\n\nBottom line: Check it out.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.\n\nOur service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.\n\nI'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.\n\n\nNote to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.  I haven't heard back anything.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).  \n\nOverall, my haircuts were never good.  Mehh at best.  I've been to three different stylists there and only one of them spoke to me while cutting my hair.  That can be an awkward hour long hair cut... And the salon is dirty.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, I believe that the hair should be wiped off of the chair.

But it seems the bay is actually one of the top places to more likely find such coffee shops, where a cappuccino is actually a cappuccino.\n\nSo here's this awesome spot in Las Vegas I've personally found, the first so far in this city.  It was worth walking past a few Starbucks shops on the way here! It is literally written on their walls how they value making coffee right here (there's cool chalk drawings of the differences between different types of orders, TVs showing the farming process, etc). \n\nThe shop is really clean and rather spacious. It's a nice place to even study, have a conversation, or just meet, with outdoor seating as well if you really wanna. It's currently nicely air conditioned indoors, well furnished with tables, and for the jusr 3 times I've been around they've played a nice variety of music.\n\nAfter all I've said about crafting a cup of coffee well, I'll say it was amusing watching another customer complain outloud, asking what was going on today, and how her \"furtado isn't even hot enough\" ^_^ ... What is to note though is how they handled it. They were generous enough to make another one, and just maintained courteous service pretty much. Besides that they've just been the nicest people so far, nice to talk to.\n\nBonus support: Bruxie is pretty close by, if you want a more filling waffle & chicken meal first.

The owner was very nice and the company was licensed and bonded so we thought we were in good hands.  We had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.\n\nWe thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  \n\nI was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.

I don't have the energy to  write a detailed review because for the last year and a half, my energy has gone into playing phone tag and  complaining about  the lack of service from my usual tech. The day I received my keys for my house a year and a half ago, I checked out the condition of the pool. The pool was clean but the vacuum was very slow. I called to let them know it's not working properly an was told that I need to turn it on.  That was their attitude towards the situation. My reason for calling that day was to avoid what actually ended up happening....which is a pump replacement. For the last year and a half I have been calling to say that, basically, the pool is constantly dirty and green because it's not working and have asked if someone can check it out. Usually, my request is ignored. If, somehow magical forces collided, and the tech actually does take a look, I have been told that the issue is an o-ring replacement or a diaphragm replacement.  I have paid for parts multiple times but I am not sure if the parts were actually replaced because the issues continued. Again, my concerns were ignored until just recently they told me I need a new pump. I am irritated because they are sayin I let the pool get too dirty and that's why the pump has gone out. I  have tried to complain about the tech letting the pool stay green during the winter months but nothing was done about it. Their response was that the tech never mentioned anything about it. Of course not! He would be snitching on himself for not doing anything about it. They tried to tell me that the pump went out because I never had the cleaning service done. I never did because why would I have them brush the steps and tile when I do that myself and I do not trust them enough to take care of the other comps ta of their cleaning service because they rob me already by not doin anything when they see the pool needs to be backwashed and when the pool is green. Plus, they never said the cleaning service is needed for the pool to function properly. They were only trying to up sell this service. \n\nAlso, this company will try to sell a service to lower yor calcium level. Don't fall for it. They will call and email you about it...DO NOT fall for it. Many pool companies try to sell this service but it's bullshit. My bottom of my pool contained a lot of dirt because the vacuum wasn't working and it was green for months but the tech never took the initiative to fix it but yet I'm getting calls AND emails about my calcium levels. Really? The tech will report that but NOT a green pool? I do t think so.\nPlus, while speaking with an overly defensive customer service representative today, this individual read through all of the notes and NOT ONCE did he mention the calcium levels were high. That's because it's all fake.\n\nThe only reason why I am a customer is because of the salt pump.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0},

The employees and owner all live up to the name and their mission. The owner came by to check out my situation the next day after I contacted Honest Pool Care. He was very eager to check it out, as he was concerned about the problem becoming worse if we waited too long. He was very thorough during his visit. He wasn't there for the full hour. Therefore, he had no interest in charging me for the full hour visit. He gladly reduced the price for me. Awesome! He could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes. He told me what he thinks might be the root of the issue but stressed he would talk it over with some repair techs to be sure and to avoid unnecessary costs and repairs. After discussing with his crew, he called me to inform me of their findings the following day. I love that this company is on top of things! Regretfully, I was a former Poolman customer. Dealing with that company is like pulling teeth. It takes a week just to talk about an issue with that awful company.  He was honest and told me what he had initially thought was the issue, no longer seems to be an issue at all. He explained to me what was going on and offered me options to fix this problem.  I appreciate that as well because he could have easily taken advantage and  only offer one solution...one where his company would profit. Experiencing this level of great customer service helps to ease my nervous attitude toward this situation. Also, I must note that I live in South Phoenix. I called multiple pool companies that claim they service Phoenix and surrounding areas. However, none of them were willing to come this far south. Honest Pool Care, according to this site, services Tempe and surrounding areas. This company is willing to come to this area. Also, they could use horrible business tactics and \"tax me\" in a way for the drive but, thankfully, they did not. I absolutely love this company.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.\n\nSince we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy\n\n.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.\n\nAs i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.\n\nAt this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space \n\n\nI was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!\n\nDon't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.\n\nBUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!\n\nIt is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!\n\nI would highly recommend the Promenade location.

I've been going to Ichi Ban for a couple of years and have to say that its the best sushi you can find in downtown. They have a lot of specialty rolls such as the phoenix suns roll, spicy Tuna with unagi on the top with dressing. Pretty tasty. Their sashimi is fresh and made to order. The only bad thing about this restaurant is when your eating and it's not busy, they seem to be spying on you and makes it a lil uncomfortable for  you peeps that can't stand that the staff is looking at your every move. For me, I just want goo sushi and this place definitely hits the spot.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I'll keep this review short and vague, promise. I spent the best 100$ in my life shopping here over the weekend, enough to feed me for a month.

Do NOT, and I mean DO NOT come here for an oil change or any service. As soon as I pulled my truck in, I noticed two gentlemen sitting in their stalls doing paperwork. Both just sort of looked at me like a lost little child or soul, trying to find their parents and without the tendency to come out and just say we will be with you shortly. So I waited 10 minutes and just as soon as I was about to hope back in my truck and drive off, a gentlemen comes out and asks me sorry about the wait but what can I do for you. ? I want an oil change how long please? About 1-1.5 hours. Okay long story short, there were others in the waiting area bitching and nagging about the super long wait and Never again will they come here.  After about a 99.5 minute wait I go outside and ask my advisor, do you know how long until my car is ready. It's been over 1.5 hours? Let me check... Waited another 15 mins till my 100% charged IPhone had about 20% left . Finally went back outside and this time I walked into the auto area and saw my truck just sitting there. I go and let him know what's my truck doing there?  Looking puzzled, he goes to the back yells out a name and said bring the truck up! Then he looks at me and said I guess you don't have time for the free car wash eh? Paid and left.  That's how my experience went.  You've been warned","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I use to go a lot back then, when the owner Alex somehow disappearred to the Middle East ( maybe finally getting married ).  They use to stack their portions with a lot of meat. Since new ownership, they are cut back on the protons but the food is awesome as usual. Their mix grill and chicken kabobs are a must try. With the aromatic smell of their rice along with a side salad with greek dressing, it compliments the meat very well. Their homemade lemonade was very tasty and the owner is very nice along with his staff. Kinda like home cooking except when they get super busy, be prepared to wait awhile, but well worth it.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Got to Thai Hut, menu was pretty simple to choose from.  We got our food pretty quick.  I had the yellow curry chicken. It was mediocre at best. My colleague's Beef panang tasted pretty bland. Chicken was prepared probably in advance as it was not as hot as we had hoped. Prices for downtown is reasonable and the service is fast.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

It is a standard older hotel that has been updated. Rooms are still small but modern. Staff are friendly and helpful. We stayed in a room by the elevator and ice machine. So it was not the best room.

Plus the costs at Madison's is much cheaper and the food better!    The venue at Madisons is a little different sort of like comedy in a long trailer but then the DC Improv would stuff people in like sardines so for us no problem.  Anyway we love it especially from what we had in Virginia","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
