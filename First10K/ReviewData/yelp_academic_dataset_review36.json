Service is horrendous, all the time.  Whether sitting with a total of 4 people at the bar and 2 bartenders working or sitting in a booth with a server, the service is not good. I will spare all the details of our last visit but it was bad service (had to go to the bar from our booth to get drinks), bad food (brisket was 50% gristle) and we had tables on either side of us full of dirty dishes for the last 20 minutes we were there. This is management 101. There is a manager who seems to spend most of her time as a food expediter rather than managing the restaurant.  She'll walk right by you and your empty glass in the bar and not say a word.  Not even hi.  I don't get it.  I wish it was better.

I never felt less beautiful and would have liked to complain, but I didn't want to embarrass my daughter.\nLess than a week later, I went to another salon to get the cut and style I'd originally wanted, and she asked if I coloured my own hair, because I'd \"missed\" a lot of spots, and my colour wasn't consistent.\nIf Fortelli treats all 'new' clients this way, they better have a strong customer base.

Four sundays in June for $40--never mind that I live an hour away, never mind I'd be out of town for one of those sundays...I. Wanted. To. Live. My. Dream.  Yes, it's a save the last dance\/step up kind of dream but dreams are quirky.  You want what you want.\n\nI told this all to the husband, he quickly agreed-not because he really wants me to achieve my dream-he didn't mind spending a day in Madison every week.  \n\nThe dance space is nice, a bit over the top pink but there was a respectable mirror ball.  My instructor, Jeanne, was friendly and, more importantly, helpful.  The first 15 minutes was a little warm up, learning some pretty easy choreography and then the majority of the class was learning a longer hip hop piece.  We learned a chunk every week and put it together at the end.  I felt pretty accomplished by the end of the lessons and wanted to continue the dream...\n\nThe studio offers lots of different lessons, even a thriller workshop or a britney spears set of classes, and---my next dream: west  african dance.  I had been to Mali and there is really nothing to compare dancing with live drums; you are alive and you are joyful.\n\nI either wish I lived closer or they moved here...but moving to beloit? or janesville? hehee....highly unlikely.

I've known some good frite:  I used to work 5 blocks away from pomme frites in NYC and have basically tried all their toppings.  \n\nI love the fact that it's a stone's throw from the trader joe's and the neighborhood is precious.  The pedestrian walks have flags you can pick up and drop that you can use to cross the streets; parades can happen ANYWHERE.  \n\nSo, we went after 1ish and it wasn't too packed but noticed there were only two servers.  We weren't in a rush so I thought it would be fine. We ordered and since the husband, whose first love in potato, wouldn't share, we each got an order of frites.  Husband ordered the cheeseburger, our friend Kate got the reuben and I got the avocado BLT.  \n\nAnd then we waited, and waited.  I had to order coffee or else I was going to pass out.  I had just finished a hip hop class so I was starving.  Their beer selection was impressive, with husband pointing out that they serve Wychwood beer, from his hometown in the UK.\n\nWhen we finally got our orders, I noticed the portion of frites were huge and regretted not sharing them with Kate.  I also noticed that a) husband said no tomato and look! tomato and b) the avocado was missing from my AVOCADO BLT.  It took some time to flag the waitress and then she apologizes and brings a plate of sliced avocado for me.  I was like, 'um, great, i get to assemble my own sandwich'.  I drowned out my grumpiness in frites doused in mayo, because fat makes everything okay.\n\nWe felt guilty because we over heard the waitress tell a table that they had run out of frites.  We had ordered the last ones.  But then I thought, hello? it's your signature dish--how can you run out?\n\nAnyway...I would try it again and see how the dinner menu goes and taste their booze.

Check in was very quick an everyone is very friendly. We've been here for almost a week now. I can say the room is big an at first it was clean but I noticed as we were there for a few days my room wasn't very clean things were not being stocked an sheets have hair on them pretty nasty even the towel had a stain on it ugh gross  I also can say if you want towels you need to leave a note or you only have 2. Our room has no refrigerator only one we can't use cause it's filled with alcohol an the prices are outrageous. There is no coffee maker cause they want you too spend money in one of there expensive restaurants or cafe. The bed is uncomfortable an pillows are small  be careful for the 33.00 resort fee. Don't understand what I'm paying this for. There's 4 pools only 2 open. There really is nothing special about this place. If I ever come back to Vegas I definitely won't stay here not worth the money. It's not even on the strip. Oh before I forget the pool we did use was nice an clean water was great. Just crowded. They do have a shuttle only runs from 10 to 5 an good luck if you get a seat  it's small an there's only one. Just not that great of a place an yes we are in Vegas but jeez for the money so not worth it...

She kind of glared at me and walked away after pointing to the pedi chair for me to sit in.  I sat there for over 15 minutes waiting and she was no where to be seen.  Not one person acknowledge me or cared that I was just sitting there.  By the time Kim came over she did not even look at me once through my entire appointment.  I told her I wanted my toe nails square and cut short but to not cut the sides with the cuticle cutters. She proceeded to cut two toe nails out of the ten.  It had been about two months since my last pedi (I usually come every two weeks) so it was obvious my nails needed to be cut.  When I asked her to please cut them she kind of snarled and was so annoyed.  She hardly filed them and the scrub at end was pointless.  My nails are uneven and look horrible. She may have been having a bad day but a pedi is a treat for me and if she is grumpy she shouldn't have helped me.

I have to be very careful with dairy consumption and while I'm very thankful for their dairy free cheese.. Their only red sauce is not dairy free... I understand they have bbq sauce and garlic rub... But to me pizza isn't pizza without red sauce :(","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The whole experience was contrary to what I expected though.  \nFirst, the cash part.  Come on, what is the reason for not taking credit cards when the whole world accepts it?  That you might die and credit card might not get cleared?  \nSecond, the menu.  Just a handful of items?  I was expecting something more than just a burger \/ fries and hot dog.  \nThird, the food itself.  If you make your burger in lard and is supposed to have 1000s of calories, it should be tasty, rt?  Or so I thought.  I finished it only because I just wanted to avoid a scene of arguing with them that I don't want spanking even if I did not finish food (though most of the people over there seemed to enjoy it - maybe I am the minority, but it was not fun for me).  I think it is the chilli that spoiled the taste of the burger.  But whatever it is, the taste was nothing to write about.\nFourth, the ambiance.  I will rate the indoor atmosphere only at the same level of McDonalds or Burger King.  \nFifth, the security - locked doors only to be opened by security after verifying you paid.  Why?  I mean, they seriously make you feel like you are in a mental assylum with the nurses costumes and the spanking machine in the middle.  No problem for me with a restaurant having security, but I have never seen any one watching at the door so closely as if people eating there might run away in the middle without paying.\nI definitely think they have a unique theme that can attract people.  But make a great tasty food worth the calories and improve the ambiance - it can be a game changer.  Also, please be a bit more family friendly or advise that this is not a family friendly place.  As a family man \/ Christian, this place has been my first big turnoff place in US.  I have been to a variety of restuarants before.

Last night we went with our two-year-old son and hoped to have a quick, simple meal. The restaurant was busy with other families but not overly full. Servers passed by us as we stood at the door and the bartender (who we also assume is the owner) waved us to an open table, where we waited to get menus. We ordered two burgers and pasta for the little guy. It took more than 30 minutes to get our meal and my husband's burger was not prepared as described (or having experienced it at other locations).\n\nSince this is the second disappointing experience, it was clear to us what is wrong with this restaurant. The kitchen is clearly mismanaged and cannot handle being busy. Food quality is inconsistent, even when ordering a simple burger. Tip: do not order the steak.\n\nIn addition, it seems to be poorly run as there is no rhyme or reason to how people are seated and served (a table that arrived well after us received their appetizers and we were waiting on our only order).\n\nWe have had good experiences at other Shoeless Joe's and want badly for this location to thrive on a difficult strip of Eglinton but their kitchen needs to step up. We'll give it one more try but after three strikes, you will be out Shoeless Joe's and we will make the drive to Bayview for other restaurants.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Loved the flavors and the spices underlying them. Quite honestly, I believe that you could basically order anything and love it. Ethiopian for those who haven't tried it before generally includes eating food with your hands on a bready-pancake like food where all over your selections are placed upon allowing the tastes from those selections to seep into the bread.\nExpect portions to be filling and fairly large.\n\nNow that said, I will admit this won't be the best written review because every review should tell you what that person had and ideally include a photo. I'm admittedly doing neither mainly because I did love the food and it was already halfway gone when I realized I should have taken a picture.\n\nWhy 3 stars? I came here with my mom who had heard about the restaurant in an article and wanted to try it out. We went in for lunch at about 12:45pm and even though the standing sign outside displayed their hours and said they were open, the sign on the door said closed. We tested the door anyway and found it to be open.\n\nMe made our way inside and were struck by how dark it was (it was a cloudy day outside and there were no lights on in the restaurant) and secondly by how empty and bizarre it felt. The only light coming in was natural from the windows. The music added to that obscenely strange atmosphere. It was the WQED station on the radio playing a rather dark and mysterious piece.\n\nNeedless to say, we stayed, and enjoyed a wonderful meal. However, service was a strange element as well. It took 20 minutes or so for food to come out which is fine but once we were finished with our meal, we waited half an hour looking for someone to take our check. Since we were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time we were there for lunch on that Friday, we would have expected them to be a bit more attentive. It wasn't until we finally hunted someone down in the back of the restaurant that we were able to pay and leave.\n\nThe food earns this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars. However, service and ambiance kept it from receiving a full 5.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I looked up tire companies and teetered between going to Walmart, which I figured would be least expensive, and Norris, a local and family-owned company. The insistent advocate for small business in me won (despite how poor I am these days), and I called up Norris. I am SO glad I did.\n\nI called at 9:00am and talked to Scott. I told him my story and asked if I could bring my car in this week or next. He said to bring it on in today, and then asked if a tow truck already had my car. No, I hadn't called up a tow company yet, and he said not to worry, that he would take care of it. He took down the description of my car and its location and said he would send someone to pick it up.\n\nLess than an hour later, Scott calls me to say that my car would be ready in HALF AN HOUR. In just 1.5 hours, they had arranged for my car to be picked up, had gotten it to the shop, and had the new wheels on my car.\n\nThe price ended up being very fair, and especially considering the short time it took and the outstanding customer service. On my way out the door, Scott told me they rotated the new tires to the front (it had been my rear tires that were slashed) -- something I hadn't even asked of them. What professionals!\n\nI went from being quite moody about the car vandalism to being completely happy and positive. While it sucks that people out there slash tires for no good reason, people like Scott & the other staff at Norris restore your faith in humanity.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1},

I can't recall her name, but I wouldn't be surprised if she one day becomes a recording artist on a major record label, as she hits all kinds of notes, effortlessly! So there I was, enjoying the music, and the dancing, when another element was injected into the show....comedy. I truly wasn't expecting it, but it was a good surprise. The comedian not only told jokes, but also was an impersonator (James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson), and worked his way into one or two of the acts with the dancers. \n\nThe combination of the music, dancers, costumes (or lack of), and comedy, created a great evening for me. And I'll mention, that I'm a gay man, and I thoroughly enjoyed this topless show, so it's definitely something for all adult audiences! Although the show is sexy, it's not sexual, if that makes sense. Anyway, it's worth checking out. Oh, and one last point, if you sit int he first couple of rows, you'll get a chance to have the singer and dancers come by and shake their boom booms in your face :)","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Every place I went had hot hot hot women's shoes, but the men's shoes were so boring and department store-like.  Then, while walking in The Forum, out of the corner of my left eye, I spotted a pair of leopard skin men's shoes, on a pedestal, which I swear had my name on it.  I took two steps back, and made an immediate left turn into that store, determined to walk out of there with a pair of shoes that I knew I'd never see on other men on a regular basis.  Armed with that criteria, and a good eye for shoes that pop, the sales woman, Isabelle, set out on a journey to help me fulfill my desire.   While Donald J Pliner did have some standard designs, such as classic black loafers, the majority of the shoes were made to be the star of the outfit, more so than the clothes.  A calf skin loafer and boot, leopard skin buckle over loafer, silver loafer with metallic embellishments, were just a few of the amazing pieces they had.  I walked out the door with a pair of silver sequined shoes, with hand-sewn glass beads, creating a sparkling stepper.  As I took them out of the box, other patrons in the store were begging me to do a runway model walk of the shoes, which I was pleased to do.  While there were four shoes there, which I wanted, my luggage could only accommodate room for one pair.  Though, on my next trip to Las Vegas, a second pair will likely be obtained.\n\nThe sales staff are knowledgeable of the makings of each shoe, where the materials come from, and where the shoe is assembled.  If your size isn't in stock, they will order the shoe for you, and have it shipped to your door.  Though I wasn't in the market for women's shoes, I can say that if the men's shoes were as awesome as they were, then the women's collection must be even livelier.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":3},

Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel\/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.  \n\nThere was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.  \n\nThough the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the \"casual\" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Though I could always go for a serving of their thick hot chocolate, it was the mushroom and ricotta pizza, which drew me in to have a seat.  Being alone, I opted for a comfy bar seat, which was a great idea, because the bartender was there to take care of me immediately, and check on my regularly throughout my time there.  I loved the flat rate pricing on the drink menu, $6 for cocktails and wine, and $4 for beers, regardless of brand.  That mushroom and ricotta pizza, along with a glass of sparkling wine, were my choices for the evening.  The pizza was a perfect-for-one-person sized flat bread, with mozzarella, chunks of ricotta, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes, with a drizzling of balsamic vinegar.  The smooth ricotta, combined with the chunky bite of the mushrooms, and the crispness the crust, offered a great combination of textures.  The sun dried tomatoes provided the perfect amount of saltiness.  Though this was the only food item that I ordered, I eye witnessed other bar-seated patrons ordering other things, and making positive comments about what they were indulging in.  Because of my surrounding observations, I may just have to come back and try a few more things.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

There's lots of options on the menu for Korean dinner and meats. It's about $27 for AYCE which is worth it because most of the a la carte dishes are at least $20\/ plate. We decided to order individually instead of doing AYCE because we had 7 people and there's no one we could eat our worth. The soup bowls are medium sized so I suggest sharing one unless you can finish the whole thing by yourself.

The wait was 40 min for our group of  9, but it was so darn worth the wait!!! I literally wanted to order everything on the menu; they're known for their hashes and Benedicts. \n\nKeep in mind that you aren't going to get the traditional Eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce.  Instead, they create their own special sauce and everything we ordered was delicious! We ordered:\n\nSage Chicken Benedict: Crispy Sage infused chicken on top of a mountain of carbs (2 grape size biscuits and mash potatoes) smothered in a creamy Chipotle sauce with sauteed spinach. One word: Heavenly. \n\nMeat Loaf Hash: Meat loaf was tender and well seasoned. Best part, you didn't overdose from the salt because there was barely any! \n\nBlueberry Pecan Pancakes are as gigantic as a large pizza and was crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. \n\nSage Chicken & Bacon Waffles: This meal changed my life. I never understood the hype over Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles or the new Lays Chicken and waffles potatoes chips, but this dish seriously was the best ever!! The sage not only elevated the super juicy and tender chicken, but the fried leeks seriously took the dish to the top level. I wish they had chopped bacon bits throughout the waffle rather than just one strip, but their homemade maple syrup wasn't overly sweet, so the juxtaposition of sweet and salty was like an explosion in your mouth.  \n\nWe are definitely coming back here every time we're in Vegas.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":2},

Based on reviews, we tried their famous Duck salad with pomegranate, pine nuts, and sprouts The braised duck was super tender, but overly salty because of the sauce, but the pomegranate and pine nuts was a nice touch to the salad. The next option was the deep fried scallops with chili mango sauce which ended up being the only star dish of the night. You get a slight crispy outside with perfectly cooked scallops and the sauce was sweet and spicy. Boyfriend ordered the signature Hakkasan cocktail and that ended up being very delicious, so I would recommend it. Third dish was the pea sprouts and crab sauce which was very bland and didn't live up to it's hype. The crab sauce lacked flavor, so imagine a bland sauce on top of bland vegetables, it wasn't worth the price. The 4th dish received mixed reviews, we loved the tender and juicy fillet tenderloin, but we weren't impressed with how extremely salty it was. Supposedly their intent was to create an edible fried funnel cake like garnish under the tenderloin, but the batter was bland, hard, and inedible. When we told our server, he didn't even do anything about it or apologize! For the price we were paying, I expected better quality and service. To us, these dishes are described in an exotic way; however, if you really think about it, these are just typical Asian dishes that you can make at home. Overall, we were very disappointed with our food adventure and will only return for the scallops and drinks.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The service was definitely lacking, you get ice cream or mochi at the end of you meal, and it took 20 minutes for the check and another 20 just to get our green tea ice cream. 40 freaking minutes to get out of there despite reminding two different waitresses 4 times!!!

The over-priced and under-sized old fashioned was about half sugar, the jigger used was not filled and half of what was in it was spilled on the bar.\n\nWhen ordering food we were told the choices for sides were chips or fries, and that other sides would be an extra charge. No problem, we got fries--only to find that they also charged another $4 for the fries. After waiting 40 minutes for food we waved the bartender down to say that if the food wasn't started to please cancel it as we had to leave in a few minutes. Fifteen minutes later she came back from the kitchen, having not come back to the bar the whole time, with our food.

Lee Jones, the new car manager, took my information, stated he would ca l me back the next day, and I did not hear from him until I called him back a week later. On that call he did not apologize not getting back to me, no did he offer a remedy.  To make things worse, he told me to call the GM and the hung up in my face. \n  His actions are not professional nor are they acceptable.  A few weeks later I  had to reach out again in regards to financing.  Mr. Jones took the call and said he would call me back the following morning.  The following evening I received a text from a random number discussing some finance info.  I asked who was texting and what was it in regards to. The response was, your Infinti payment.  How unprofessional! To text and not call, but not even to identify who was texting, Lee Jones, is just unacceptable.  DO NOT buy a car from Infiniti of Scottsdale.

Dave the owner is a COMPLETE flake.  My story starts with attempting to order boxes advertised on their site and he refers me to another company.  I sent an email asking to set up a move date, no answer.  I call to set up a move date and he says he has that date available but to send him an email reminder to confirm.  I sent another email, no answer.  I call and he says \"Oh yeah, were you the guy who emailed me?\"  So I send another email and finally get a confirmation for 4 guys and a truck between 8-9 AM on the moving day.  I call Dave on the moving day at 9:15 when he isn't there.  His response when I ask him where he is, \"Ohhh, were you today, I think I got my schedule mixed up...  I am way out in West Phoenix, but I am on my way out right away\" but he only hasone other guy with him.  When I suggest the idea of a discount because of this he hems and haws and says we'll see.  Later he gives me some story about he got an email saying an auction date was moved back so he cancelled my appointment and I tell him I have no idea who that email was from but it sure as hell wasn't me.  An hour later I get a call from another moving company who wants to charge me more money and not move until that night.  When I ask what happened to Dave \"coming out right away\" they basically say I don't know and said they don't think Dave is coming and I am stuck with them.  They go one to not make it out to my place the next day and overcharge me, I have another bad review to write and go post for them.  Don't believe whatever BS excuse Dave posts to excuse his flaky behavior.  Just talking to the guy you get a sense he has a horrible memory and isn't very professional.

We called in to a popular HVAC company to get a recharge of freon. The inspection pointed to a leak in the evap coil. Called home warranty company, was given several horrid companies to do the work. Did a Google search and STB came up as the top rated result in the Gilbert area. Thankfully, we were able to choose our own contractor for the job!\n\nCalled and spoke with Ashley, who is AMAZING at ensuring you are treated like royalty, is very knowledgable, and answers all my crazy OCD questions (and should receive a raise! ;)) She told me someone will return my call with an estimate. Ryan, who is equally amazing, called back almost immediately and sent me an estimate within twelve hours. He then came out after business hours to do a second diagnosis inspection. (Ryan also deserves a raise! ;)) It turns out it, in fact, IS the evap coil leaking.\n\nThe next morning, I get a call at 7:30am saying that the installers will be there at 8:00am. Danny shows up and expediently gets to work, removing the offending coil. Dean shows up a little while later with the new coil to replace it. (Again, Danny and Dean deserve a raise for working in the hot attic for a couple hours!) The install went well and both were very efficient in doing their work. They were also very friendly, which is refreshing to see with installers!\n\nAdditionally, Ashley helped setup the communications between STB and my home warranty company, which was really appreciated, as I was getting a bit annoyed by said warranty company at that point...\n\nOverall, I will say that because of the above and beyond service I received from Ashley, Ryan, Danny, and Dean, I will not hesitate to call them for any future HVAC needs. I recommend them whole-heartedly!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

I went in for the first time to this office and my experience as a patient was worse than I could have imagined. First off, the doctor reminds me of that doctor from the Simpsons that will perform heart surgery on you for 5$. He is so creepy and when I came in, I could visibly see him in the back fixing his hair in the mirror, and walking around doing literally nothing while I waited for 30 min. When he walked into the exam room, he didn't shake hands or give any personal touch that a \"doctor\" might be able to comprehend is necessary and advantageous to his private practice. Further, the equipment is literally from the 1800's, I stepped on a scale that said I was 190, I'm 220 pounds... they literally WROTE DOWN my medical history whereas most reputable Healthcare providers use-I don't know- a computer? Worse yet, they put that piece of paper into a file that looked like one Benjamin Franklin would have used when he was researching electricity. At the end, he needed to get my medical records from my old Healthcare provider and he literally gave me a form and said, \"Go fax this to health span and bring your records to us.\" I was like.... wtf am I paying you for? That's literally the worst doctors office in Ohio.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The first was during opening weekend where there were some kinks to be worked out. Or so I thought. \n\nAs a non-drinker, I found my latest attempt with Bandit to be disappointing. I asked for a Diet Coke and they don't sell it. Then A virgin caesar. Nope. Ok. Just a coke (even though I don't like sugar drinks) \n\nService was sketchy with drinks and food coming out at random so our group didn't actually eat together. Apparently the kitchen was \"backed-up\". Hate to see what it's like on a Saturday night when full. I don't blame servers for that, though our server was mildly absent minded. We were a large confused group, so again not necessarily all their fault. \n\nI love the atmosphere and ambience. A little loud, which creates a fun vibe. \n\nThe food, for me is the reason I keep giving this place a try. The steak is really good, and I love the fried chicken. The other people in our group seemed to really enjoy the food and craft beer they make. \n\nThe sticky toffee dessert is good, but not exceptional. Asked for a coffee to go with my dessert but apparently coffee is not on the menu either. Sigh. \n\nThe food is really good, but I would love to see them add some better wines, cocktails, and mocktails so that food and drink pairings work well. Not everyone loves beer, sorry to say. \n\n\nI will be back with beer drinking friends, but many more of my friends drink wine or not at all, so that leaves Bandit off my list for much of my entertainment dollar","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It is great which is why I keep going back. It would get 4 stars but for what follows. \n\nThe service is the problem for me- I have been there frequently for 45 minutes watching tables (like 3)that arrive after us get served and leave before our pizza arrives. It seems like they staff one hard working, competent server AND one poor server per shift. Or the kitchen is just disorganized?\n\nAt other times I'm the guy getting my food and leaving in a reasonable time. \n\nIf it were consistently slow, I would only go when in the mood for a leisurely date night and be perfectly happy.  But with my luck, that would be the night everything arrives in 15 minutes and there is a huge line out the door with pressure from the server to pay my bill.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},
