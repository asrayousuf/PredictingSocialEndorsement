Being very unfamiliar with the area, the local building structure and the dry weather landscape, we definitely needed a buyer's agent. We researched on Yelp and came across Faith Harmer from Urban Nest Realty with excellent reviews. We called Faith and described our situation. Even when we were still in NC, Faith set up a MLS page for us with houses meeting our requirements. As soon as a new listing came out, we received an e-mail message. When we made the move in our RV to Las Vegas, we met Faith and Heidi Tuai in the office. They gave us a very detailed overview about the current market and answered all our questions about the different areas in Summerlin. Then we went house hunting for 1 1\/2 weeks, changing our mind about the ideal house several times. Seeing the houses, yards, neighborhoods in reality is a much different experience then just exploring them on the computer. Heidi and Faith guided us through this very emotional decision process. We had always experienced that they put our personal interest first. Heidi and Faith never tried to push us in any direction or to higher priced properties. When we finally made our offer, they guided us through the buying process, helped with the inspection and any outstanding repairs. Now we have a house where we feel at home again and in an area that fits our needs.\nI highly recommend Faith and her team for all your real estate business.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular.\nSides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them. \nDessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!! \nDrinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening. \n\nThe service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak. \nIn the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon.

I told Luis I needed a smog check and he abruptly said their smog check machine was down and again quickly asked the gentleman behind me what he needed. I asked Luis for additional assistance (where was another Jiffy Lube that could help? Would the machine be fixed by tomorrow?) but was met with no additional information and no willingness to help. I expressed frustration about standing there for 10 minutes with no one acknowledging me just to have the machine broken and he said he was working under a car in the shop, didn't see me and rudely and sarcastically told me to have a good day. I Walked out and will never be back again. I'd rather go to another business for this service and pay double Than be treated so rudely. And the icing on the cake? Luis was the assistant \"manager\"!! Some manager he is.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

When I took a tour I was very impressed and excited to enroll my daughter here. The lady doing the tour (Kirstin I think?) was so nice and friendly. The first few weeks were just \"okay\". I wasn't impressed at all and was already looking for a new place to take my daughter. The teachers were not very attentive. They were often found sitting around talking rather than tending to the kids. My 2 year potty trained daughter very often came home with dirty underwear as though they hadn't helped her after using the bathroom. The teachers were nice enough but seemed inexperienced and uneducated. I never really connected with them or the director or the front girls. The school didn't feel very secure and anyone could easily walk in at any time. The doors were never locked. I found a new school for my daughter but it didn't open till August (at this point it was April). We were just going to leave my daughter until then but then they had a 4 year old kid walk out of the facility through an unlocked door without anyone noticing. It wasnt until a Good Samaritan found the little girl at a busy intersection that they realized she was missing. The families were never told about this incident. I found out by reading the news on break at work. I was very upset and immediately drove down there to talk to the owner. I was not at all satisfied with the way she handled the situation and couldn't bear the thought of dropping my daughter off here each day, wondering if she'd slip out too. I immediately pulled my daughter out and enrolled her back in our old day care. Even though it meant commuting 40 additional minutes, it was worth the piece of mind knowing my daughter was safe. \n\nThere were some positives - This facility does provide meals each day which I liked. The facility is clean and the tuition is fair. They have a nice curriculum. I just couldn't get past a kid walking out without anyone noticing. I had to pull my daughter out.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

She has an open door policy and is always available to discuss your child's needs. She can always be found greeting each of the children by name as they are dropped off and picked up. The facility is very secure and I feel at ease knowing my child is safe each and every day. The curriculum is great and well thought out and my daughter has learned so much from her time there. They taught her sign language before she could even speak and as she got older, she learned yoga, Spanish, colors and alphabet while she was still in diapers! The teachers have a loving way of teaching respect and accountability and the kids are very well behaved. They have two great outdoor spaces and separate the kids based on age.\n\nWe moved at the beginning of the year to the other side of town and still commute an hour round trip twice a day just to bring our daughter to The Goddard. That's how amazing this school is! We are moving her to a closer school in the fall and I know we will miss The Goddard greatly. All of the teachers and directors and the owner Jyoti are amazing and they all feel like family. There is no other school that compares to the experience we've had here.

I decided to write this review because the last appointment I had reminded me why I love this office.\n\nOffice? Beautiful. Staff? Friendly. \n\nThe dentists are thorough and the hygienist is probably the nicest hygienist you will ever meet. The Doctors are great. You can always depend on them to be honest with you. Options are always given. Sometimes appointments start a little late but when they do take you in you are out just as quickly. I have only met the lady doctor once before and it was pleasant but Dr.Michael is usually the one I see when I get a check up and he is quick and efficient.\n\nThe hygienist is very honest, patient and thorough. She wants to know how she can make your experience better throughout the appointment. She always welcomes you with a smile and leaves you with the receptionist with a smile. The experience is completely different from dental offices 15-20 years ago. My whole family, including my kids, love her. You can see the difference when you sit with Karen because she cares. My first appointment with the office several years ago started with her. I used to hate dental offices and Karen completely reassured that dental offices are not something to fear. She actually said to my son \"Am I scary?\" which she is not, she knew how to diffuse a \"scary\" moment. She is gentle when cleaning and thorough. \n\nOverall atmosphere is great. The Receptionist is friendly and experience is well worth it.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I could be wrong but the omelette definitely tasted like it had some sort of filler which I think is why it was so big. Is this standard practice in restaurants? \n\nNext, let's talk about coffee. Well, there's nothing to really talk about. Diner style refillable, weak coffee. But you know what? I didn't even mind because crappy coffee fit pretty well with the overall ambiance. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for brunch if someone wanted to go. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a place I'd bring someone to.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I liked the large open kitchen and the wooden counters. I liked the fairy lights and the spacious seating area. \n\nMy friend and I were lethargically greeted and seated by a guy who looked like he wanted to just get out of there. My friend got the Cioccolata Calda (Italian-style Hot Chocolate) and I got the %70 Fleur de Cao which was different than her's which was hot chocolate where as mine was cocoa based. We also ordered the Cacao 70's Cheesecake. \n\nThe drinks came and they were actually really delicious. I have to say that I've never had hot chocolate\/cocoa this good. They were rich and thick and creamy. If anyone has seen that scene in the film Chocolat when Vianne is pouring cocoa into the cup for Armande and it's perfectly dense and rich... well that's how our hot cocoa\/chocolate was. I liked her's more, it did have quite a thicker consistency, allowing her to drink with a spoon. I wish mine also came in a cup instead of a  fishbowl-like glass which made it hard to drink from since it was quite hot after pouring in the cocoa. It also detracted from the warmness that you should feel from drinking cocoa, I feel. \n\nBut what I didn't like...well a lot actually. First the price. I'm sorry but $8-10 for hot chocolate? Really? Sure it was really good, but I'm not used to paying so much for hot chocolate. Secondly, the cheesecake. Presentation wise, I'd give it a 1.  It gets 1 point for drizzling red raspberry sauce on the plate, ok fine another point for nice cut strawberries. Otherwise, it really seemed like they scooped (yes scooped) the rest of the cheesecake that was left and plopped in on our plate, smothered it with whipped cream and called it a night. It must have been some excellent quality whipped cream that we were paying for then because that's mostly what we ate. The little bit of cheesecake I guess was okay.\n\nWe couldn't finish our drinks because we were too full. I don't think there will be a next time for me but I'd recommend just getting either a dessert or drink. The drink would've been satisfactory for me.

Always listen to your server, ALWAYS listen to your server - especially when you are in the capable hands of one of Ken's highly trained wait-staff. We broke the rule and regretted it.\n\nThe 5-star moments: Bellini cocktail made with real peach puree and real Prosecco, Asparagus wrapped with Parmesan and prosciutto, Watermelon-Cucumber salad with mint and balsamic.\n\nThe Good: Great server, very conscientious and accommodating, knew his menu and knew what the kitchen would do (almost anything you request if they have it in the house), attentive to our fellow-diner with mobility impairment. Also good - the service was attentive but not rushed, the Chicken picatta rivals my favorite all time version and the sauce on this one was thickened just a little so it would cling to the pasta. The chicken was flavorful and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe Bad: They served a dry gin Gimlet with blue cheese olives instead of lime (eww). The table was in outer Solbovia from where we came in the front door. (They need some low-tops in the first room by the front door.) The server did not offer prices for the menu specials - which upon receiving the bill created a bit of a shock - the $30 entree salad was lovely with it's 5 sea scallops and mound of fancy greens, but it wasn't $30 good, even at a Ken Stewart restaurant.\n\nThe Awful: (here is where we broke the rule) The decision was between a pizza and the lasagna for one of our party. After much discussion and consultation with the waiter the lasagna was chosen. BAD DECISION. It was not \"Bolognese\" as there was not enough cream in the sauce to even begin to color it and WHERE was the meat???!!! The large serving of undercooked layers of pasta and scant fillings was covered with what I would call Marinara at best and pureed tomatoes at worst. Do NOT order the lasagna. To be fair - they offered to take it off the bill for us and the waiter did remind us that he had \"tried to steer us away from it\" and toward the pizza without ever coming out and saying - \"you won't like it\". We laughingly had to admit he did in fact try to save us from ourselves.\n\nThe Unforgivable: As I mentioned earlier, one of our diners that evening is mobility impaired. She had carefully descended to the dining room down a set of 5 rather steep steps, but to go to the restroom she decided to take \"the ramp\" (a long switchback of ADA required wheelchair access). \"The Ramp\" winds its way through the back areas of the restaurant and our diner saw things on her journey she should never have seen: carts and tubs of dirty dishes and table cleanings lined the entire ramp making it impossible to use the hand rails (required for someone in our amica's situation), the floor of the ramp was littered with lettuce shards and a slice of lemon. The topper of the entire trek was to be assaulted from above by someone throwing something over the upper railing down into one of the bins of garbage below. Fortunately, for all involved, the detritus missed our guest, but did land on the floor near her feet.\n\nTo be fair, as we were leaving Ken was coming in. He listened attentively to our \"teachable moment\" about the ramp situation and was clearly not pleased. He dashed off to have a look himself and I am sure we will not see this particular issue again. We neglected to fully disclose the lasagna problem but will let him know via phone.\n\nThe bottom line: as with many owner-named restaurants, if the owner is on-site the place is amazing. This is true of all of Ken Stewart's establishments. Since he can't be at all three at once, he needs to rely on the most exacting mangers to be his 2nd in his stead. Tre Belle failed this test. I will try them again for lunch or maybe check out the \"rustic brunch\" on Sunday. I would certainly go back for Bellinis and appetizers. Not so much on the special birthday\/anniversary dinner occasions. And next time I will listen to my server.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Not once were our water glasses filled while we were there, so I had nothing to drink with dinner. It seemed like they were short-staffed or something, as there wasn't anyone to flag down.

The blanco was nothing special to me. Yes, I'm from Chicago and prefer deep dish, but the think crust had barely anything on it. The cheese was lacking, as was the garlic. My husband's arugula pizza had the opposite problem. Bar Cento cures their meat in house, and the prosciutto on the pizza was the saltiest meat I have ever tasted. We love our Italian meats, but my husband summed it up when he said he actually preferred the pizza without the prosciutto.

We had full use of the pool for two days, after which the heat was turned off without notice. Then it was closed for \"major repairs\" according to Almira, the building manager. The pool was, however, permanently closed without noticed in favour of a \"gym\" which required little to no maintenance. \n\nNo reduction in rent was offered when this amenity was taken away.

It is absolutely AMAZING! (and as all of their curries are). I have tried yellow curry at almost every place in Phoenix, and it is because Thai Lahna's is best I put up with the mediocre service. I have called to place my order many times to pick up after work and been put on hold which has meant any of the following (since they don't have hold, it's just the phone being put down): 1) being hung up on 2) being left on the counter forgotten about as I've heard many people place to go orders at the desk. There is one employee that has such a piss poor attitude and looks like she hates her life, but everyone else seems great. One time I placed a pick up order with a friend of yellow curry and vegetarian yellow curry. We picked our food up and went on errands. During our errands we get a call saying they gave us the wrong order and didn't include a vegetarian and we could bring it back. We said okay, we're on errands, we will. Apparently it wasn't soon enough for them because they called us back and asked where we were. When we returned they made us show BOTH the yellow curries and took one back, which I guess is fine but every other restaurant I've ever been to would let you keep the extra, and considering we drove back, I would think this is fair. Overall, I will be going back, but only because the yellow curry can't be beat.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I was given a fair price on repairs, and told the whole car would be buffed of minor scratches and marks from the accident.  I received my car back and thought all was good.  However, I noticed some damage and had to return.  After I returned and that was fixed, the front fender popped off a bit from it's repair.  Over the next few weeks I noticed blemishes from the original accident that weren't fixed.  Between work and school I literally had no time or transportation to return my car to Elwood, and was so annoyed I'd already been back once I didn't want to return.  I feel I just received someone without much attention to detail, and while I wouldn't go back, I have a hard time believing if my ex and his family have used them for years they are all bad.  I would suggest asking for workers that have been there for years.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

This will be the third time that I have used his service within 2 years and the thing that impressed me most is the fact that he remembered my father and I specifically when I called him earlier this week.  He is prompt about returning phone calls and scheduling as soon as he can.  I also have always been more than happy with the level of quality that he produces.  I have multiple rental properties which means that sometimes the carpet is not given much care from the tenants but by the time George leaves, it looks nearly new!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},
