The man behind the counter was very friendly and chatty and gave me a piece of falafel to try out while I waited for mine to be cooked. I was very pleased - it was delicious. Crunchier and less greasy than any falafel I'd ever tried before, and much more flavorsome. To make conversation I mentioned how nice the baklava looked, and owner only went and gave me some to take with me as a little present! \nBecause the food was so good, I ordered Shish Kefta, Grilled Chicken, and Kibbee to go \nThe Shish Kefta was so good and melt-in-your-mouth tender, The Grilled Chicken was very juicy and full of flavor   and the Kibbee was crunchy and very tasty. \n\nI would definitely go back there if I am around Cleveland.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

If you look behind you at the rest of the restaurant, it's cute. Decor taking cues from the viceroy hotel for sure. Hipster black and yellow, life size horse lamp.\n  I ordered a cocktail, the club soda was flat. I also ordered the Cobb salad. Errrrr, it's hard to mess up a cobb salad. I was excited to see \"5 minute egg\" as one of the ingredients as I love a beautiful yolk, but it came out on a square of iceberg lettuce. This is only okay if you've ordered a wedge salad and they disguise this cheap lettuce by drenching it in blue cheese. I cut into the egg... lovely. So, why is my salad sort of watery? Like maybe they rinsed the lettuce and didn't spin it? The whole thing has a slimy feel.  Plus an excessive amounts of pickled onions, which I'm a fan of generally. I'm about to order something else cause I can't choke this down....wish me luck. \n  Ordered the tartare. Interesting and pretty good. Pickled mushrooms and mushrooms crisps on top (yum) but half way through,  there was so much mustard, I got queesy.\n  Staff was lovely, it was absolutely freezing, I left.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all.

I had been emailing Tom at Friendly Computers and told him exactly what was wrong with my hard drive and what Geek Squad and other techs had told me (that it would have to go to a clean room in order to recover my data).  Being desperate because all of my 2 year old's baby pictures and videos are on that hard drive, Tom gave me hope (false hope) so I took it in to him.  He told me he was 60-70% confident that he would be able to retrieve my data.  I had to pay $169 flat rate fee and leave the hard drive with them possibly for a couple of week.  About 5 days later he calls me and he tells me that he can't get any of my data.   He offers to send it to their clean room lab for an evaluation but the $169 that I already paid them was not gonna be refunded to me.  I told him I paid $169 for nothing and he said well it wasn't for nothing because we've been working on it and trying.  This sounds to be like a great way to scam people.  Tell them you think you can help them and get them to pay the $169 all the while knowing that you can't get any of that data but you sure got their money.  Wonder how many others are out there that have been thru the same situation.  Also, I have read this sales agreement\/receipt 3 times and don't see where it says the fee is non refundable even if they can't retrieve your data.  Maybe I'm overlooking it but I don't see it.  DO NOT GO TO FRIENDLY COMPUTERS.  They are not \"friendly\".  They are major con artists, scammers, liars, etc.  Don't waste your time or money and don't get your hopes up.  I got my hard drive back from him minus my $169 that was wasted down the drain and he probably erased all my data so that no one else would be able to recover it since I refused to let him send it to his lab.

They were one of the cheapest and affordable in the area. The only reviews I read said they were slow. I had time so we decided to try them. They were okay at the first counter.  Set us up with a car, and sent us down to the garage to get our car.  This was not easy to find and no signs to there counter in the garage.  Another rental place had to show us where they were.  When we got over there, they were slow. They handed me keys and said here is your car go find it. If there is a problem with it let us know. We found the car? It had many dings and scratches down both sides. We stopped to report those, and the agent acted like we were wasting her time. I had to point out all the damage, as we walked around there we dings in the front and back too. We thought we were okay, the car ran fine the week we used it. When we returned it they tried to blame the dings and scratches on us! We said no way! They found the report where we reported the damage before we left. They then said okay.  We signed tge final paperwork and left. But a month later they are trying to say we did the damage and charge us 1000.00! I am fighting it, but my insurance company told me this is not uncommon!  Its is so wrong! If my insurance company steps in they saif they can get it lowered most likely,  its hard to prove or investagate. I would still have to pay my debatable. . It has been a horrible experience.  We never use them again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

That was not the case here.  I would say that our room was a step up from the Motel 6 down the street. \n\nWe were placed in one of the Bungalow rooms, which is essentially, the older section of rooms.  It has three floors with one side facing the pool and the other facing a loading dock and the Tropicana roof.  If you are lucking enough like us on our anniversary, there will also be a roof access door that is cracked open about 20 feet from your window so any Tropicana employees that happen to walk through that door will have a clear view into the room.  No luck in switching rooms either.\n\nThe carpet, furniture, and mustard yellow wall paper made it feel dated, along with the cracks in the ceiling.  The only updates in the room that I could tell was a 42-inch flatscreen TV and the shower.  \n\nThe lobby looks nice and updated, but the casino itself is pretty small.  We ended up spending most our time elsewhere.  Pool look decent, but was crowded.  Half of the area was empty as it was reserved for 'special' guests.  \n\nIf I were to do it all over again, I would have saved the extra cash spent on this supposed 4-star hotel and booked at one of the other 3 star casinos nearby that have better rooms, bigger casinos, and better location.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Parents are encouraged to give feedback and suggestions and they are very responsive to parents' inputs.

My initial impression was great because they seemed to be so kind and caring towards our kiddos.  However, from a business perspective they are terrible.  They are very difficult to get a hold of, whether if it's to make an appointment or ask a question.  We had an appointment and when I called earlier in the week to confirm the time, I did not get a response.  The morning of the appointment I reached out again to ask how much time they'd need for our dogs because we had a potential conflict and had to leave the house 3 hours out from what I was guessing was our scheduled time.  I thought maybe we could do 2 of 3 dogs, but wasn't sure if we could get all 3 done.   When I did get a response back, it was a text saying they were cancelling our appointment entirely.  No call to answer my initial question of how long they'd need or a discussion to figure out an alternative solution (I could have easily had my mother come to the house).  Then Mitch went on to say that they might not be the best service for us because they prefer customers that have recurring appointments and they were raising prices.  A...they never discussed a desire to have recurring appointments, which we'd be happy to do if we were aware it's a requirement and B...there had been no discussion about a change in pricing.  Instead they cancelled on us within hours of our appointment and implied I was lucky they weren't going to charge me a cancellation fee.  Then I find out they decided to groom other dogs that were in the neighboring house they were at that morning. This was ridiculous.  Clearly it was more convenient for them to take this other client and cancel on us, but this is poor business.  It has taken us weeks to get scheduled with another mobile groomer to take care of our dogs (which I have found to be much more professional).  I would not recommend this service due to poor communication and business practices.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.\n\nSo, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.\n\nApparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.\n\nCase and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0},

The steak cobb salad is also really good with melt in your mouth croutons, avocado and a great dressing.\n\nI've always had great service here and the food is consistently great.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.  And there is a one hour \"driving\" fee of 80 dollars to initially get to your place.  So, the very minimum the service will cost is 240 dollars.  Seemed pretty reasonable.\n\nI hired All My Sons to move the furniture from a one bedroom apartment to a different unit in the same complex.  The new apartment was about 100 ft away from the first so there was no real \"driving time\" involved during the actual move.  All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.\n\nIf you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.

However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (\"soon-deh\") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!\n\nChik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)\nWin!\nThis was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the \"special spicy sauce\" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.\nThe slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.\nAnyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.\nNot a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.\nI also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.\n\nTang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)\nSoggy :(\nA childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.\n\nKalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)\nSkip this...\nI've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.\n\nMandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)\nDeep fried goodness!\nAnother dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!\n\nI was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.\n\nCho Sun Ok!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":3},

Held on the last Sunday of every month, it has a different atmosphere than some of the more widely advertised festivals.\n\nI love wandering the streets as I shop at the various markets and try different treats.

In the spirit of Pedestrian Sunday, some locals were playing music and there were children selling some fun treats.\n\nAn oyster-loving friend was happy to discover these on sale outside of New Seaway Fish Market. Shucked to order, there were 4 varieties: French Kiss, Lucky Lime (PEI), and Kumamoto (2 for $5) as well as a BC variety (3 for $5).","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":4},

The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. \n\nTom Collins Cucumber Gazpacho\nLake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin \nI enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.\n\nSmoked Black Cod Brandade\nCrispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostini\nThe crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)\n\nShaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress Salad\nSpiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gelÃ©e\nI enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gelÃ©e quite a bit. The gelÃ©e was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.\n\nLake Erie Pickerel \nWild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigrette\nIn spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this!\n \nSwiss Chard Torte Verde\nBest Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde frisÃ©e, chives\nThe warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.\n\nSeared Cumbrae's Flank Steak\nDuck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioli\nCarefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.\n\nCallebaut Dark Chocolate Torte\nEspresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugar\nTorte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter\/fruity\/saucy for this dense dessert.\n\nGlobe Summer Berry \"Mess\"\nVanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berries\nYum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. \n\nEwenity CrÃ¨me Fraiche Panna Cotta \nCandied lemon zest, wild blueberry soup\nThis is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. \n\nOverall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!\n\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/07\/summerlicious-2010-globe-bistro.html","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Tender and juicy, I savoured it to make up for the disappointing salad and so-so calamari. The bun was a typical white hamburger-type of bun - too bad, really. I think that a great bun on a good burger makes a world of difference. The fries were decent - nice, thin, a little on the softer side (like the calamari! Perhaps this is just their style)\n\nThe patio and interior are simple and great for a summer brunch or lunch. Fresh, sunny flowers at each table, simple decor, and comfy couches created a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. However, for the value I don't think I will be returning for lunch...although I may give the weekend brunch another go. Maybe.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Mission accomplished!\n\nA very late dinner on Pi-Tom's patio coupled with pleasantly humid weather made a few of us reminisce of travels to Asia. Usually bustling & full during dinner, we arrived around 9pm and had full reign of the patio! Still decorated from the Pride Parade, the colourful patio is enveloped in plants and trees, making you forget that you're in the downtown core.  \n\nYum Mamuang (Mango Salad)\nGreen mango, red onion, chili, mint leaves, lemon juice\nA great start to our dinner, the ingredients were fresh and the lemon juice-chili combination complimented the mangoes quite well. The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.\n\n\nFish Cakes\nDeep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long bean\nWhat a pleasant surprise - when I heard \"fish cakes\" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish. Instead, we received tasty well-marinated slices accompanied with a hearty peanut sauce. The sauce was full of peanuts and flavour with a smooth, non-oily texture. I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!\n\nChicken Satay\n4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber salad\nTender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.\n\nThe servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time.\n \nAuthentic Pad Thai\nThai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepe\nWhat a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or \"sweet and sour tomato sauce\" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicely\n\nDuck Curry\nRoasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basil\nFull of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.\n\nPeanut Chicken\nChicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long bean\nThe simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!\n\nPlamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)\nSquid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauce\nA generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!\n\nGoong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)\nStir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.\nAnother favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. \n\nBy the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!\n\n*Update*\nPi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)\nThumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. \nMango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":2},

Also ordered were the honeydew-avocado-banana and a lemonade made with crushed mint leaves and sugar cane. ($4)\n\nI liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeÃ±o \"bite\" after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeÃ±o.\n\nThe honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.\n\nThe Squirrel ($10)\nPeanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye\nHow could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.\n\nI'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...\n\nThe Beach ($10)\nChick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye\nNot bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.\n\nThe Fish Fry ($14)\nGolden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.\nThe Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.\n\nThe following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.\nSoupe de Soleil ($4)\nThe butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.\n\nBlack Beans ($6)\nThe black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!\n\nJulies' Pies!\nOoh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see \"Julies' Pie\" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where\/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was \"reaaaalllly good\" with a knowing \"omg\" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.\n\nAnd \"reaaaallly good\" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a \"bite\" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.\n\nThe service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.\n\nOverall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

A great barbecue joint beside a Mr. Sub and Funky Thai 2 Go? In Oakville? Hmm.\n\nBrightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.\n\nSweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. \n\nGrilled Portobello Mushroom Melt\nArugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, GruyÃ¨re Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia\nA generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruyÃ¨re. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruyÃ¨re pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, \"meaty\" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!\n\nSouthwestern Club\nHickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta\nWe were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!\n\nEl Cubano \nPulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun\nY-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered \"nontraditional\" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!\n\nFlat Iron Steak Burrito \nDrunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro\nUnable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...\n\nMixed Barbecue Sampler\nHickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw\nI came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!\nThe ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.\nThe beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!\n\nCake and Shake!\nBlackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake\nThe chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake. Creamy chocolate mousse layers nestled between dense cake was a great way to end the meal. If you like frothy and richly-flavoured milk shakes, you will love this. Mmm...\n\nIf you're looking for a savoury sandwich, Oakville's Sweet Smoke Barbecue & Grill is worth a visit! Friendly service (although we did accidentally get a sandwich that we didn't order), warm meaty sandwiches, and a bright interior made this a great place to grab a bite.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2},

Rec this place for lunch\n \nTried:\nEggs Charlotte ($11.50)\nInsomnia's hollandaise sauce has a bit of a cheesy flavour. It adds a bright colour and if you like a bit of cheese, then you'll probably prefer Insomnia's hollandaise over some other breakfast joints. The eggs were well poached - not as perfectly as Hoof Cafe's but still nice and runny and the side of greens was good to nosh on between bites.\n\nEggs Manami ($10)\nOrdered off of their \"Brunch Features\" menu, the Eggs Manami had wonderful curried rice patties. This is a delicious alternative to English muffins, and I recommend this over their regular Eggs Benny.!\n\nHome Fries\nTheir home fries are great! The potatoes are freshly tossed in a bbq-y sauce, and they're not at all soggy. These were quickly snarfed and definitely worth adding to your order if they don't come with it anyways.\n\nFrench Toast\nHeaven on Earth ($10.50)\nYummy - It was crispy and filling with a generous amount of fruit. The cream cheese was good, but I would've enjoyed it just as much without. I'm not so sure that the strawberries were wild as advertised, but they were fresh! This was great drenched in maple syrup.\n\nBaked Pancakes ($10)\nSo these aren't so much pancakes as cakes-baked-in-a-pan. They are huge and are made to order and from scratch. They are very thick and dense, and take at least 20 minutes upon ordering to arrive. We were definitely stuffed after polishing these off!\n \nChocolate Banana Pancakes & Apple Cinnamon Pancakes\nWhile good, I don't think I'd order it for myself but as a post-breakfast treat to share with a larger group.\n\nOverall, Insomnia is a bright cheery breakfast joint in the Annex. I recommend it if you're looking for a tasty brunch at a great value. Their pleasant service, bright dining and bar areas, and great brunch options make it a great choice. Definitely a step up from other local breakfast joints that I've tried with respect to service, atmosphere and quality of food. Get the home fries and their egg dishes are quite tasty.\n\nI've also been there for dinner. If you go, you *must* try their Climax Cake. It's as good as the name suggests ;). Flourless chocolate torte, wonderfully dense and rich - I would return just for that dessert alone! Their pizzas are also quite good and named after Toronto neighbourhoods - I tried their Annex pizza. Their Mediterranean Platter and fries with aioli are decent appetizers to share with the table - but the pizza would be better.\n\nErin\nhttp:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":4},

Every dish was fantastic, and the duck was crispy, non-fatty, and flavourful.\nKnowing that it takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be prepared, we ordered one of their House Specials to tide us over as well as some white rice.\n\nSzechwan Shredded Beef ($10.95\n)Crispy yet tender, crunchy but not oily, this was the perfect dish to ease our hunger pangs while we waited for the duck. I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.\n\nAuthentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95)\n1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast\n2. Duck Stir Fry\n3. Duck Soup\n\nCourse 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin\nI could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist.\nWith it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.\n\nCourse 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps\nThere were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just \"fillers\" for the dish to look bigger.\nWe eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.\n\nCourse 3: Duck Soup\nLast to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem. I can only imagine how wonderful this soup must be on a cold, winter night.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":4},

It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!\n\n \n\nI had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.\n\n1a. Burrito Boyz\nHalibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large\n)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!\nThe tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.\nI almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.\n1b. Big Fat Burrito\nPulled Pork\nI lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!\n\n3. Burrito Bandidos\nSteak Burrito\nThis is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.\n\n4. Z-teca\nBeef Barbacoa Burrito\nTried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.\n\n5. Chipotle Mexican Grill\nCarnitas\nOwned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice\n\n6. Burro Burrito\nSteak ($7.99 Large)\nLocated beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ\n\n7. Burrito Loco\nChicken Burrito\nSo close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!\n\nOf course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.\nSteak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto\n\nHonourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:\n1. The Fish Store\nTried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado\nHonestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.\n\n2. NY Subway\nPotato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito\nThese aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

A fantastic outdoor back patio includes an outdoor bar and lounge areas. \n\nThe service was pleasant and patient - We were given a bread basket with crispy flat bread seasoned with tarragon and a few slices of white bread. It was accompanied with a rather plain marinara sauce, which foreshadowed the upcoming meal.\n\nBaby Red Romaine & Escarole Salad\nCara Cara orange, fennel, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and old wine vinaigrette \nA light start of fresh lettuce, a slightly tart vinaigrette, ripe Cara Cara orange, and cheese. While the orange and the dressing was enjoyable, something was left to be desired...perhaps it's because of my unrefined wine and cheese palette, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Memorable Summerlicious starter salads include the butterleaf truffle salad at Truffles at the Four Seasons (which has since closed) and Tutti Matti's carpaccio salads.\n\nBigeye Tuna Tartare & Spicy Sopressata \nCracked olives, garlic grissini, arugula, lemon and Sicilian organic extra virgin olive oil \nFresh tuna tartare on a bed of salami was a welcome dish, especially since I've never tried sopressata before. The saltyness of the cured ham paired with the freshnesses of the tuna created an interesting balance between bites. The olives were typical, and the bread sticks brought a crunch but no flavour to the plate. Perhaps if they were toasted a bit more or rolled in sesame, it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.\n\nWild & Tame Mushroom Soup \nSix kinds of mushrooms (no butter or cream)\nThick, warm, and hearty - this had the rich texture of a comforting soup despite the lack of cream or butter. I was impressed with the consistency and I love the taste of mushrooms so I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. As with the salad, there was something lacking - the \"wow\" factor that I always hope for at 'licious restaurants. The best mushroom soup that I've tasted was Wild Mushroom Soup from Tutti Matti - unfortunately not on their current menu.\n\n\nGrilled Top Sirloin Fettina\nCharred onion, heirloom tomato and rocket salad with crumbled Gorgonzola\nThe vegetables were nice and warm, and the sauce surrounding the steak sweet however the steak wasn't particularly interesting or great. Tender and nicely cooked, it was a good, simple cut of sirloin but didn't blow me away or leave a lasting impression on my palette.\n\nGrilled Jail Island Salmon\nPickled summer beets, heirloom carrots, watercress salad and horseradish crÃ¨me fraÃ®che\nDespite my half-success with the fish at Biff's Bistro, I decided that it was worth another go. While tasty, I'm quickly getting bored with this Summerlicious lunch. The beets were nice, warm, and soft and the horseradish crÃ¨me fraÃ®che had great flavour. However the salmon was...just salmon.\n\nRoasted Portobello Mushroom & Brie Quesadilla\nCaramelized onions, pico de gallo, chipotle crema, plantain tortilla chips and cilantro cress\nMy personal favourite of the entrÃ©es, the chipotle cream had a tangy flavour that tasted great with the pico de gallo and quesadilla. The pico de gallo (salsa) was ripe and simple. Always a fan of portobello, these quesadillas had great flavour. While an interesting visual, the tortilla chips were lacking the flavour I usually enjoy from plantains. As a plantain chip lover, they were a disappointment. I'd rather crack open a bag of the Samai Plantain chips that I got addicted to Barbados.\n\nChocolate Toffee Crunch Cheesecake\nDulce de leche cream\nThick cheesecake that was more toffee-like than chocolate. The caramel was pleasant with the dense cake. I wasn't a fan of the bit of toffee that accompanied the cake but overall I'd say that this was the best dessert out of the three.\n\n\nBavarian Vanilla Cream\nOntario strawberry compote and dark cherry balsamic\nNice and warm with a smooth texture, the vanilla cream dessert sat on one of the better compotes that I've tried. I found myself scooping this dessert up more for the compote than the cream.\n\nCoconut Rum Baba \nTropical fruit salad and banana cream\nThis spongy cake was covered with coconut shavings over pineapple, mango, and lychee. A sweet, generous drizzle of rum syrup soaked into the cake quite nicely. While I wasn't the biggest fan of this dessert initially, over time as I enjoyed my company it grew on me. It wasn't too rich or filling.\n\nWonderfully designed and decorated, Jump CafÃ© & Bar creates a vibrant, young, and upscale environment quite well. I would return for a drink at the bar, and the service was fantastic. However, I thought it was missing that the \"oomph\" factor that would make me wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for future Summerlicious romps. This is a good spot to take someone who wants a very simple no-frills meal.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.\n\nThe cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.\n\nBone Marrow Strawberry Beignets\nWinning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long Peppers\nThese delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please!\nThe two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!\n\nBeef Tongue Grilled Cheese\nWhen I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction.\nPacked with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!\n\nSuckling Pig Eggs Benny\nPerfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalapeÃ±o\nThe Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them.\nI recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.\n\nBrioche French Toast with Foie Gras\nO-M-G.\nI could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done.\nThe Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life.\nWords can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME.\nA $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to...\nEverything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.\n\nPics : http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/hoof-cafe-charcuterie-brunch-love.html","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.\nAll offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.\nThe star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow ($9)\nHollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.\n\nTongue in Brioche ($13)\nThe sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.\nIncredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.\n\nRaw Horse Sammy w\/ Hot Sauce ($22)\nFresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The \"HORSE\" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.\n\nVisit #2\nCrispy Pig Ear Salad\nStrips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing\nI liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.\nThe pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...\n\nFluke Crudo\nFluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.\nI really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)\n\nN'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle\nHouse tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.\nMmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!\n\nPork Belly, Squid,& Melon\nBaby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.\nWhile the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.\n\nCalf's Brain Ravioli\nHouse ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings\nSo...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)\n\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html\nPics: http:\/\/cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com\/2010\/09\/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Me and 12 friends booked the party bus expecting a great Vegas club experience. Let me start by saying the hop is a club crawl. Meaning you walk through the casinos to get to the various clubs. \n\nTo start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. \n\nFollowing LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. \n\nDue to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. \n\nFinally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours. \n\nDon't waste your money. You'd be better off renting your own limo bus.  Note to Posh...

My husband has been coming here practically since it opened and it is the freshest, tastiest, fast Mexican food out there.

Fajitas are out of this world but I find I can't stop myself from ordering the nachos the past several times I have been. Their red and green salsa is delicious (very important) and they even have an actually spicy hot sauce instead of a wimpy excuse for hot sauce that most places have.

Perhaps we are not accustomed to eating BBQ in such quantities, but we hardly made a dent. The variety was very good to sample each of the meats that are offered, as well as two sides. Meats included full rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, meat loaf and chicken. We started with the ribs, and while  happy with the portion, I must say that I was disappointed in the meat itself. I'm not sure if they were baby back ribs, but they tasted more like side ribs, and were kind of dry. I am not a BBQ expert, so maybe real BBQ ribs are not supposed to be moist, but if juicy is wrong, then I don't want to be right! The rest of the platter was decent. The sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. We got fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I love sides in general, and all of the sides were excellent. The fries were crispy but not overly crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy and sour, but not too creamy, and the potato salad, topped with some paprika, was one of the best that I've had.

That day, the manager reprimanded one of the cooks; not only did this slow down the food being prepared, but it was unprofessional.

The fish taco was fried, the batter was good, not falling off of the fish like many places. The carne asada taco was not as good as the first two, but still enjoyable. All 3 tacos had pico de gallo , carne asada had pickled cabbage. \n\nMy favorite was the beef tongue. I was very apprehensive about it at first, because I've seen raw beef tongue before... its not pretty, but now, I look for restaurants that serve it. I have yet to find one as good. \n\nUnfortunately, I drove by a few times and the windows are blacked out, so I assume that they have since closed.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

As we walked in, I was immediately doubtful of my agreeableness. Not only was the restaurant empty, there was an Asian man mopping, and he looked to be the chef. He quickly greeted us, told us to sit anywhere and brought us some hot green tea. At this point I was confused - green tea with pasta? But we went on anyway because he was actually very friendly, and I felt like I just walked into my uncle's house. \n\nWe ordered the butternut squash ravioli and the osso bucco. After ordering, the chef disappeared a while. When he returned, he had two bowls of butternut squash soup and some garlic bread. While it was a little bland, I enjoyed the warm soup on a cold day, and appreciated the complimentary amuse-bouche while we waited. \n\nNot long after, our mains were served and I must say I was impressed. My SO's osso bucco was accompanied with vegetables and some penne pasta, while my bowl had 4 large ravioli in a rosÃ© sauce, which was perfectly cooked. While I am not a pasta expert, I believe that the ravioli was made fresh and in house. The pasta itself was slightly chewy, with a generous amount of butternut squash in between. The sauce was a little overwhelming but I swept some of it to the side, which the bf gladly soaked up with the garlic bread. The osso bucco was also delicious; the veggies were cooked well, as was the pasta. But the star of the dish was the veal. The marrow was a nice treat to spread on the garlic toast (and on its own), and the meat itself was soft, tender, and well-seasoned. We ended the meal with complimentary tiramisu, which was excellent. \n\nOverall, Agio has a homey atmosphere, with delicious food. While small and easily missed, it is worth it to give it a try. Don't let the ethnicity of the chef deter you; as others have mentioned, he lived and was trained in Italy for many years.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

I thought that the burger was pretty good; I really liked the cheese and the bacon was very smokey and flavorful. I really like the bun - it was slightly chewy and toasted with butter. Also came with a pickle. \n\nWhat really stood out were the fries that came with the combo. I believe that the fries were twice fried with sea salt. I am definitely a fries girl and these were one of the best! I probably wouldn't pay full price for the burger ($19), but perhaps I would might just to have the fries.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It was very hard to breathe and my eyes were getting dry but this was quickly turned off when the waiter noticed that I was trying to find the source of hot air. Sign of good customer service. \n\nWe ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture. \n\nOf the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor. \n\nI believe that there is great potential here at kintori, and will eventually live up to the standards set by its Guu counterpart.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

And I get to try out different things on the menu. While quite pricey, and can be replicated at home at a fraction of the cost, its a nice place to spend a few hours with friends catching up, or studying. \n\nYou are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base. Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough, and the soup is actually good? I'm not sure.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

As mentioned, on the weekends, you can order sweet shrimp sashimi. At first, I was apprehensive about ordering it because I've had bad sweet shrimp at non-AYCE places, however, it was very fresh and good size (sometimes, sushi places have tiny, tiny \"sweet shrimps\"). \n\nEverything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert. They have black sesame ice cream, which I've never seen at AYCE sushi before, along with other jellos (black current and litchi), mango pudding and a chef's special. \n\nWhile pricey, $24.99 on the weekends, I would say that its worth it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

In particular to sushi restaurants, I usually get some raw fish and my SO gets a bento with cooked foods. \n\nHere at Sushi House, I ordered the salmon chirashi and he got a bento. The bento was not too special but the chirashi was very good. The rice was well seasoned, with a  generous portion of salmon, along with other little condiments on the side like marinated mushrooms and pickled radish. After the first time, I always order the same thing. \n\nThe owners and chef are Korean and so the sushi is a bit different from Japanese or Chinese sushi.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Cantina definitely delivered in this respect. On the table, there are two hot sauces, the red one, chipotle based, and the green one, SPICY! \n\nWe ordered the octopus taco, fish taco and the LA truck taco. The combination of flavors worked very well. Each was enjoyable but the octopus was particularly good. I'm not sure how they cook it, but it was soft and flavorful. We also have the ceveche and plated chorizo burrito. The ceveche was not what I expected; I could have used some more salt and lime. The burrito was quite good, and unique. It had a fried egg on top, along with many sauces. \n\nThe reason for 3-star rating is mainly because of the price. With so many other fusion taco places around now, changing $5+ for a taco seems to be a bit steep.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
