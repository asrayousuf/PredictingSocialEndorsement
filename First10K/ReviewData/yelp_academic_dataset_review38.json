I am not going to complain a whole lot about the food quality.  I ordered the Lasagna and it was quite good with a great bolognese sauce and garlic toast.  My wife had a burger that she devoured with good fries as well.  Serving size was average but adequate.  I would give food quality 3.5 stars.\n\nHowever . . . sticker shock was an understatement.  Read the menu for yourself and make your decision, but this food was worth at most 60% of what they charge.  (It's Vegas . . . probably 40% in any given home town place.)\n\nThe service was spotty . . . the people there acted a little like they didn't know why they were there.  And the most memorable thing?  I think the sound system is being driven by an old CD player - as about every 90 seconds the cookie-cutter pop music would skip for 2-3 seconds like you used to experience when carrying your Sony Disc-man around.  At first I thought it was just a song or two, but it happened in every damn song they played.\n\nUnless the prices come down - we will trudge our way to the Food Court for a quick bite, so I expect a new venue to fill this void sooner rather than later.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I ordered the Meatball Pasta - which was actually reasonably sized (if you've been here you know what I mean) compared to other entrees.  Five rather nice sized and delicious meatballs were underneath a bed of perfectly cooked thick spaghetti and a great marinara with chunks of sweet tomatoes.  I ate the whole damn thing.  Outstanding.  My wife went with the Baby sized burger, which is still bigger than 3\/4 of the burgers out there and it was also outstanding.  The highlight was the Cheddar Cheese Bacon potatoes on the side.  If you like that tasty cheese that slightly burns on the edge of a grilled cheese, you'll get a small plateful of it on top of delicious potatoes.  Drinks were also good, and all of this for an extremely reasonable price with OUTSTANDING service.  We will be back here again!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My wife had wings that were actually quite tasty and very, very meaty.  The tiny cocktails for $12 were fine, except they took about 10 minutes to arrive each time.  Food took almost 20 minutes, and the atmosphere was a little uncomfortable because they don't seem to have a staff to bus tables.  A corner booth was left covered in food and garbage for over 30 minutes before presumably a manager came over and took care of it himself.

The tuna salad looked like they opened a can and dumped it on top. The hard boiled eggs were just over halfway cooked and the outside of the yolks were a darker green.

Too much oil was used in grilling it, because it came out greasy, leaving an oily residue on my fingers. Fries were good, but I liked the way they used to serve it with the crumbled feta not shaved\/dry feta. \n\nGuest: Malbec burger with regular fries.

What a (pricey) mistake.  Their weekend menu is really lacking, but the BF and I found something to satisfy our light hunger.  After returning to ask what I had ordered, we did not see the waitress again until she plopped the bill on our table.  No water refills, no coffee refills, no asking how the food was (not great--over-poached eggs on the benedict, and WAY overly spiced squash soup).  The size of my portion of soup was wrong (I had wanted a cup and received a bowl).  \n\nDespite trying to get her attention as she passed by our table a half dozen times, I was unable to notify the waitress that she had my order wrong and that I would really love a glass of water.  When she passed by the last time and saw my BF with his card in hand she suddenly noticed us...not that she asked how anything was.  I didn't even get a chance to see if we were charged for a bowl of soup instead of a cup because she snatched the card up before we had the opportunity.  \n\nI get that it's a Sunday afternoon and you probably just want to go home.  That's no excuse for treating your restaurant patrons as if they're burdens.  We spent $27 on a \"quick bite\" when we could have gone to Panera, had great service and walked out $15 richer.  \n\nUnreal.  At least I'll never again have to face the always full parking lot to eat at this pretentious restaurant.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We were sold on the fact that the arm rest would never show dips from elbows resting on it and if it did, it would be repaired and re-stuffed for free.  Also all the mechanics were warrantied for a lifetime.  They talked us into purchasing a Guardsman warranty and was told that if anything was ever accidentally spelt on the leather it would be cleaned and restored for the 1st 5 years.  Basically we thought we had full protection for 5 years on anything that may go wrong.  Well, 2 years later we had all sorts of problems.  We sent design source pictures of all the problems.  Some mechanical. but mostly seams that split. and the stuffing where our elbows rested was showing very deep dips as we were told would not happen\n\nAll the sudden, nothing was covered.  Then after some argument they said they would order parts for the mechanical problems and the elbow rests and we would have to pay for the labor and the seams would not be covered and would have to pay to get that fixed.  The seems were the biggest problems.  We called Guardsman, as their warranted stated the seems were covered as well as any stains. but they advised that they would not cover the seems or bother to work on the leather stains in any way, period.  They couldn't tell us what they did cover.  Apparently nothing.  It was just a way for sellers of furniture to make more money.\n\nToday the repair gentleman showed up and advised the would put on new covers on the elbow rest and repair the minor mechanical problems for $350.00. No new stuffing would be involved or was provided.  Also, he would not fix the seems and said if they did get fixed they would just do it again.  Something about body oils at the seems where the real leather meets the vinyl.  So we told him to forget it. We would have paid him the $350 and more if he could have returned it to look new but he said that wouldn't even be attempted.  \n\nI suggest you don't buy anything from this store.  They really make their furniture sound good, and are very good on convincing you they will last without problems and if problems do occur they will be fixed.  All lies.

One day we decided to skip restaurants and have lunch at the Cafe. Eggs Benedict or cafe Benedict are really very good. Especially given you can order them 24\/7 OR visit the place any time of the day and night you want. There was one thing, however, that ruined the whole impression. The fork they gave me was dirty! It had food leftovers dried and stuck up to it, apparently, either from a dishwasher or whatever they use to wash their silverware. I informed our waiter and he replaced my silverware with a new set. Never in my life have I seen dirty forks wrapped in a clean white napkin! Also, during the \"rush hour\" we had to wait for our waitress for over 30 minutes! \n\nWe picked a table overlooking the Conservatory. The view of the Chinese New Year decor was nice. But, like I said, the dirty fork just turned me off and ruined the whole experience.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I enjoy the classes offered, there is a great variety and they staff\/teachers are friendly. After 5 years, you would think that my business would be appreciated.  Nope.  I purchased a package in January of 2016 - it was access to all classes (Zumba, TRX, Barre, Ride, etc.) for $199 for four months.  The policy known at the gym is once you start your package that it starts calculating your time that day.  Well....what if someone at check in made a mistake and inadvertently signed you in for a class you never took?  Well, that happened to me.  I messaged today to check and see if everything was ok with starting my package and was informed I only have 18 days left.  I have never used this package!!! I had surgery at the time they say I used the package - not possible!  After several e-mails with one of the owners, Kim, she was not willing to hear me out and accused me of being \"one of many who purchase packages and never use them\".  Let me tell you, I work HARD for my money and am not just going to throw around $199.  I am so disappointed to have been treated this way.

Western State flooring is Home Depot's installer which to this day I am wondering how and why. The entire experience was disastrous.Home Depot requires that the materials be in your home prior to scheduling an install. Western State was super busy which meant the flooring and supplies sat in my apartment for a month prior to the install. Not their fault but still annoying. Home Depot would not provide any timeline related details prior to making the purchase- now I know why. The install was scheduled and I made sure to take the day off of work to facilitate. I live in a high rise and had to make sure I was there to let the guys in and out of the building. Well, the evening before the install, at 4:58 (they close at 5), I got a call from Western State. They had to cancel and needed to rebook for the next week. I was super frustrated- I had taken the day off of work and they waited until literally the last minute to call and cancel. Whatever. I rebooked for the following week with the contingency that I would not have to miss work. The manager said not a problem-the installers would be there at 7 am. This gave me enough time to pass my keys off and make it to work on time. Great. The day of the install 7, 8 and 9 am pass. No call from Western State. I for sure thought I was being punked or somebody had placed some flooring curse on me. When I called and asked what was happening the gal told me \"your installer had to drop something off at his dad's\". WHAT. I don't even know what to say about that. At 9:30 two young guys show up and immediately one of them asks how much I pay for rent. Inappropriate. Then they get up to my apt, knock on the floors and long story short decide they can't do the install after all. I have a synthetic concrete which apparently is a liability. I received my flooring materials in July, late September Western State tells me they can't complete the install. I ended up calling another local flooring install company, they sent someone out the same day and finished the job and I saved a few hundred bucks! Do yourself a favor and never use western state flooring unless you enjoy being terribly inconvenienced for months.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":1},

The delivery is fast and the food is delicious.  The delivery driver cracks me up! He can never seem to find our house even though he's been here a bunch of times, it's hilarious!\nI usually order the mu shu...get it! I'm a vegetarian so I add tofu to it, no problem. I also love their mixed vegetable and family style bean curd. They never have a problem altering things for me, and delivery is awesome! Get Sui Wok tonight!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}]
