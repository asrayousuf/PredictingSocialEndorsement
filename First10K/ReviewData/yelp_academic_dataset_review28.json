I'm the kind of person who will happily eat the worst pizza out there, but this deserves special mention for tasting worse, having a worse texture and makeup than the cheapest grocery store freezer aisle pizza you could find. I don't get how they make pizza this bad. I could throw tomato sauce and cheese onto a goddamn tortilla and nuke it in the microwave for 15 seconds and have something better.\n\nThat being said, their calzones and strombolis are somewhat acceptable just because they actually have to FILL the product with some ingredients (or they will give you sauce containers to dip their anhydrous product into), rather than leaving a dry, sauceless cheese on top of some stale dough like they do with their pizza. Their alfredo pasta is probably the best thing on the menu, and even then it's just because alfredo pasta is impossible to botch.\n\nThis place is good for two things: 24 hour delivery, and beer delivery. If you actually order food from them because you think it tastes good you are a nut. That being said, it fills an important niche role with those two things, and for that this horrendous establishment has a warm spot in my heart. Also, their delivery guys are always pretty friendly even at 4 AM which is pretty much the only time I ever see them.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0},

Despite my best intentions, I have just enough self-control to maintain an unsightly fast-food indebted belly, so I come here often. Much too often. I'm not sure if Misty (who is a lovely and sweet lady) finds it odd that I've recited my order to her enough times that I know her better than most of my immediate family, but if she does find it odd (and I know I do) she's excellent at pretending otherwise. If I ever come in and she asks me if I want \"the regular\" I'll know it's a sign I should cut back. But instead I'll probably just order something different. Maybe I'll add jalapenos to my burger, I don't know. I hope it doesn't get to that point. \n\nThe menu at Whataburger is pretty great - it has every option you'd expect from a burger joint and an \"all-time favorites\" menu that has some specialty burgers which are all fantastic, and though their burgers are always higher-priced than some of the other places you can go, they're big burgers. Everything I've tried on the menu has been fantastic, but it doesn't really matter, because I always order one of two things. To start, I always order a patty melt. Two patties, melted cheese, grilled onions and a sauce that I'd go into detail about if I wasn't concerned about alienating readers from displaying an alarming amount of affection for it. The patty melt is big and filling, but me being the careless fat man that I am I usually order a meal of chicken strips on top of it and make it a large. The meal comes with 3 strips, fries, a drink, a slice of texas toast cut diagonally (and we all know bread tastes better when cut that way), and your choice of dipping sauce. I always get gravy because it's perfect for dipping the bread into. Thank god they have diet Dr Pepper in the fountain so that I can keep this meal healthy and low-calorie. I always get spicy ketchup with my order instead of regular. I'm not sure I think it's better - in fact I'm pretty sure it's not, but sometimes the novelty wins out.\n\nSometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I make the patty melt the meal and get 2 honey butter chicken biscuit breakfast sandwiches instead of the chicken strips meal. That's where I find the only limitation with this place - they only serve breakfast between 11 PM and 11 AM. Fortunately I'm a goon and often don't wake up until the sun has gone down, which makes that time period take up a good portion of my day. On the other hand, what should be \"morning\" for me is often long past 11 AM. Oh and there was one other time when the guy working the drive-thru made me pull around front because it was going to take them a little longer to cook up all the food for the massive one-man feast I ordered, and he assured me he would throw in 2 apple pies for making me wait but instead he only gave me 1. I'll hold a grudge over that unforgivable crime until the day I die.\n\nBut this whataburger is open 24 hours. Even the inside is open all the time, and that's good because there aren't many other places where I can pig out at 4 AM except Filiberto's which always carries a much stronger \"you might get murdered here\" vibe at that hour, and I like to feel warm and safe while I destroy my body. I've spent enough money here to put one of my future children through college, and sometimes my individual orders are big enough that they cost more than anything you could get at a 5-star restaurant. And it might just be because I'm almost entirely classless, but I'm pretty sure I'd rather eat here.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0},

So the wife and I checked it out for our anniversary dinner.   \n\nThe restaurant is in Great Northern Mall, next to the Best Buy, so parking is plentiful.   Its actually two restaurants; the other is Bamboo Garden (Chinese).    The Tadka side has an open floor plan; it has many 4-person tables with built-in seats, and a row of booths.   A large bar dominates the rear.   We arrived ca 530pm on Friday and had the place to ourselves.\n\nService was extremely attentive.   We were seated immediately; we chose a booth, which seats you quite low relative to the tabletop.   It was a bit awkward but not unpleasant enough to request a table.     \n\nThe waiter brought us menus and a complimentary appetizer of spicy (maybe 4 out of 10) chickpeas; these were VERY welcome to my heat-loving tastebuds.  We also sampled the keema samosa and potato-cashew rolls.  This samosa pastry was very similar to filo, holding delicious minced lamb.  The potato-cashew rolls looked like hush puppies but tasted infinitely better - they practically melted in our mouths.  Neither of these was spicy in the chili sense, just full of flavor.\n\nThe main courses were equally impressive - marvelous flavors without fire.   We ordered Murgh Kalimirch (chicken with cashew nut paste) and Daal Tadka (lentils in ginger garlic cream).   Rice wasn't included, so we ordered 1 basmati rice - this was plenty for 2 people.   We also ordered Masala Papadam, which came with a thick garnish of sliced tomatoes and other vegetables.  The garnish was tasty but made it imperative to eat the papadam before it became waterlogged.   \n\nWe gorged ourselves and had enough left over for two meals apiece.

I for  one had a wonderful time at Starving Artist when my friend and I headed there for brunch on a Sunday after yoga!! The decor is inviting and not pretentious, the servers are polite but not intrusive, and the food was sizeably portioned and really hit the spot. The prices are decent too. I had the eggs benny with tomatos and fruits, and my friend had the eggs benny with avocado and maple beans. The eggs on the benny were poached to a T and the hollandaise sauce married the subtely sweet and crispy waffle well with the creamy soft egg. Even the fruits were really well chosen: a nice array of watermelon, orange and grapefruit slices, as well as grapes and berries (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries AND raspberries!). I really think my meal was perfect, not only because it was tasty, but also because it was appropriately-sized so I didn't finish the meal feeling like I had just been rendered comatose by a grease truck, which is how I usually feel when I go out for brunch, so that was a nice change.\n\nCan't speak for the coffee cuz I didn't have any, but the next time I go there, (which will definitely be soon) I'll be trying the raspberry milkshake. I saw someone else drinking their milkshakes and they looked gooood.\n\nI would say the only drawback is the long long line-up, but one would expect that for any decent brunch place. That being said, the staff treat you well while you're waiting in line and do their best to get you a table as quickly as possible. I might mention that they also have comfy couches for you to lounge about on whilst you're waiting for your table.\n\nIt's safe to say that I quite like this place and I think it's a very welcomed addition to the St. Clair West neighborhood.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

 that's fine.  we were lucky enough that there were two 4 tops available side by side.  and it starts here.\n\nthe restaurant isn't that busy, people are finishing their lunches, and tables are freeing up.  but upon our seating, i notice two employees standing by the computer seemingly arguing about something, and staring at us (or maybe both were just staring straight ahead and we just so happened to be in their line of sight).  but i have a very strange suspicion that one of the two, was the manager\/supervisor.  no matter, maybe our server was wanting to go home or something, and now she had a table of 9.  no biggie.  but when our server came to the table, they asked very abruptly, \"so, does everyone want water?\"  no smile, no greeting, no enthusiasm.  well, it was a cold day, so i proceeded to ask around if anyone would like some hot beverage instead, so i asked our server, \"what hot drinks do you have?\",  shaking her head as if i was supposed to know their selection, \"tea, coffee...\" to the tone of, it's in the menu, take a look.  at this point, three people wanted tea already.  my brothers' family was still settling down with the kids, so they never had an option.\n\nwater's came by hand, without a tray.  not a big deal, but for the inspired decor, i would think a little \"higher end\" service is called for.  again, no big deal.  our server came back maybe 10 minutes later asking, so do you know what you want?  well yes.  we ordered a few apps, and i specifically ordered a grilled chicken on a bed of quinoa to start.  our server looked at me and said, \"that's a main item.\"  well, yes, i'm aware of that, \"...but is it possible to have it come out as an app so we can share?\"  our server walked away and muttered under their breath, \"well, i have to see if the kitchen can do that.  ...yeah, but the chicken takes time to cook.\"  really.  they went to the computer and ordered everything and upon passing by, i told them, \"we're not in any rush, don't worry about things coming out a little late\".  \"yeah, i already told the kitchen\"  yeah, thanks.  you told the kitchen by just punching in the order at the terminal which was on the other side of the establishment.\n\nfood came out (the apps).  everyone loved the humus, the felafel were quite nice (sauce lacked any purpose) and when the chicken came out, it was no thicker than about two centimeters.  not a big deal to cook right?  on the plus, our server did bring us more pita (i didn't look at the bill, so i don't know if it's on the house like bread?) i mean, that's great!  but they brought it in their hand, in some open parchment paper, and plopped it in our existing basket.  is that the restaurant protocol?  no biggie.\n\nless than midway through consuming our apps, yes, the menus were still on the table.  why?  ooooh, because our main course wasn't ordered yet.  so here's the server asking us if we want to order anything else.  of course!  so we ordered (i'll detail that after).  and i knew.  i KNEW at that time, that they wouldn't time the order.  i KNEW that the main courses would come out while the appetizer plates were still on the table.  and guess what?!  i was right.  so, we shifted, and piled, and re-adjusted who got to eat what...  with a bit of tetris experience, we fit everything, but food just wasn't in front of the person who ordered.  no biggie.  just eat, clear\/stack, and eat.  without even our side plates (which are a decent size) or app plates cleared, we finished our meal.  our server THEN decided to put on that smile and ask, \"how is your food?\"  well, the food is fine!  \"do you need containers to pack the extras?\"  sure!  so they brought us containers and bags.  \n\nthat's the sum of the experience.  all the way through, i noticed that all the staff had at least one disagreement with one other staff member.  again, is that management?  why is he pissing everyone off?  \n\ni'm a pure \"front of house\" guy.  i hate this about myself, but i just can't shut my eyes when i go to a restaurant.  in fact i openly admit it to my friends and family, that i'm the WORST person to go with (especially if it's western style service).  i'm not THAT picky, but if an establishment is looking to charge a fairly higher price for the style of food, trying to break the middle ground barrier of decor and supposed ambiance, you BET i'm gonna take notice of certain behaviors.

I bought the Nihari recently and it didn't look or taste anything like one. It just tasted like a normal beef curry. No thickness to the gravy, no tenderness to the meat, even the onion on the side wasn't the crispy caramelized version it's supposed to be. The gravy was also not consistent like it should be. It looked like it was stored frozen and heated up for me. Which brings me to the next point. Why does it always take 15 minutes to serve any item? If the food was made fresh everyday, it would be in a big pot waiting to be served but that doesn't seem like the case here. Not gonna knock on the naan because it's next to impossible to find the authentic Afghani naan in Canada and this is no different. The price they charge for the amount of food is okay, but the quality is just not there.\n\nThe one extra star is because the staff is polite and the place looks clean.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I, much like many others, look to online reviews when making the decision to visit an establishment for the first time. This has been a pretty reliable practice until now. The negative comments were few, but I definitely should have taken heed to them even though they were drowned out by the many positive reviews. I only wish that my family's experience were even the slightest bit similar to those that felt compelled to sing this restaurant's praises. Perhaps your personal experience is dependent upon the cook and wait staff on duty at the time of your visit... In any event, as a first time patron to the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, I will never return. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately, that's where the positives end. Shortly after ordering our drinks, a very persistent fly or two buzzing around our table and our shooing them away seemed to go unnoticed by staff; this was my first opportunity to cut our loses and leave. Instead and regrettably, I ordered the Grizz breakfast, and my wife and youngest son the Spaghetti & Meatballs. In short, they were flavorless, cold and disgusting. My other son and daughter ordered the Western BBQ burger and Chicken Strips, fortunately theirs although nothing to write home about, were edible. The spaghetti and Grizz on the other hand were irritatingly horrible. The spaghetti looked and tasted as if someone poured ketchup over 4-day-old pasta and 2 day old, half-hazardly formed meatballs. Regarding the Grizz, the eggs were cold, flavorless and watery, which its still a mystery how someone can cook watery eggs; the meats were cold and salty and the hash browns were cold, undercooked and flavorless. The Pancakes were edible, until a fly landed on the plate.  I called the manager (Don) over shortly after receiving our food and he seemed utterly shocked that we were not happy with our order, stating, \"we are one of the highest rated restaurants in the city\". I found his defensive statement odd and completely detached from the fact that there were major issues with our order. He did however; eventually express his apologies and a desire to make things right by having something else prepared. Unless there was another cook to prepare it, I had no faith that it would be any different from our first order and declined. The waitress (Chrissy) came over to our table as the manager was there and asked if we needed anything. The manager mentioned to her that we were not happy with our meal and she gave us a look that made no effort to hide her irritation and walked away... That and the fact that the manager made no comment about her disrespectful actions was unbelievable and topped off what was already a horrible experience! The manager adjusted our bill; we paid and left completely feeling as if we just walked out of an episode of the twilight zone. I will never return, and to those that read this review and still take a chance with the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, good luck","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I told my husband, \"this place better be worth it.\"\n\nI can only review on the dishes I tried: \n1) $10 for 6 raw oysters - I've had really good oysters before, so I would say these are pretty mediocre...grimy, creamy, and lukewarm...knowing how easily oysters can go bad, why were they not stored in colder temperature?\n2) Clam chowder - it's New England style, which I don't have a problem with. It's just, again, mediocre. My husband, who grew up in east coast, was not impressed.\n3) Pan Roast with extra Lobster - they do give you a large portion of lobster. I found the dish just OK. Too buttery, fatty, and much of the same taste. (You can share this dish between two people... it's huge). You can also add spiciness - 1-10. A group next to us ordered 12. Whoa.\n\nI think I understand why people do like this place: If you are a seafood fan, the restaurant gives you large portions of crabs, lobsters, shrimps, oysters, and clams for budget-friendly price. I also realize the taste caters more to people who indulge in very rich, buttery foods. I wished I tried their jambalaya or any of the chef's specials - those do look better. I am a seafood fan, and I do not mind 1-2 hour lines if the food is worth it. For now, I am unsure if I would go here again - it's a very long wait for OK food.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

After a very short time, still without using gauges, he said that the unit was fully charged and, without weighing the tank before or after adding the coolant, he said that he had added three pounds of coolant.  I asked him if he was going to check for leaks and he said, \"No.\"  Please note that air conditioning units do not \"use up\" Freon; if the coolant is low it is because it has leaked out.\n\nThe technician said that the condenser fan was unbalanced and might need to be replaced; I should have someone take a look at it. \n\nHe then proceeded to \"service\" the evaporative cooler.  He asked me what was wrong with it and I told him one of the pumps was not working.  He said that the pump was bad even though it was brand new and that it would be cheaper for me to replace it than for him to do it.  I agreed.  He did not check the electrical system, cooler pads, blower motor, squirrel cage fan, or drive belt.  If he had checked the belt, he would have noticed that it was badly frayed and cracked;  it failed a few days later.  He did not oil the bearings or bushings on the motor or fan.  When I replaced the drive belt, one of the fan bushings was bad but he did not know this since he never checked them..  He did not turn on the water supply or check the float operation.\n\nThere were some areas on the duct work that the technician said needed to be taped but he did not have enough tape.

The technician then said that the Freon was very expensive and that my costs were $120.\n\nThe preceding report is factual.  Subjectively:\n\nHis methods of workmanship are unacceptable by any commonly accepted standards.  He did not have the necessary tools or supplies.  He did not do the work requested.  The neglect of using gauges or scales while recharging the air conditioning unit is both dangerous and unprofessional.  The fact that he did not check out most of the items on the evaporative cooler seems to indicate that he was more interested in showing up and collecting his fee rather than actually doing his work.\n\nThis is not a company that I would ever consider allowing back on my property.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Unfortunately, the other dealership would not send back the truck and would not commit to providing a timeframe for us. With 2 weeks wasted and no new truck, I was more than disappointed. Nick was able to work out a deal on a slightly more expensive package in the same engine size and get the deal done for the same price we had already agreed on. I had the Henry Brown Custom Shop (with Joey who is really helpful) add a 4\" lift, new Fuel Wheels and tires, a dual exhaust and few other items that make the truck perfect. I would recommend the team here to anyone looking for a new car. From the sales floor to the custom shop they will take care of you if you're as picky as I am you will be very satisfied.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I have been let down by the total lack of effort on the part of the sales staff a few times. Most recently I went in to purchase shoes, they did not have my size (not that big a deal). When I asked if they would have them soon, they let me know that I could come back from time to time and see (really)? I asked if I could just order the size and then they could call me when they arrived, basically the answer was no. I was told that I could order them myself online, and if they didn't fit I could return them to the store. That was ok since I also had a 20% of coupon that expired that day. They did not have them online, so I lose the coupon and still don't have an option for getting the shoes (outside of coming back periodically to check).

We had a shower removed and replaced it with frame-less glass. The quality and work was as expected. The complaint I have is with our sales person and the resolution of issues. The installers called me promptly at 7am before our apt scheduled at 7:30-8:30 to let me know they had a flat tire (these things happen) and needed to repair it at a tire shop. \nWhen they arrived they found out that one of the pieces of glass loaded was incorrect (these things happen, but probably shouldn't). \nThey went back to the shop to get the correct piece and now it would 11:30 before any work began. I originally figured this would be done by 12 latest, based on the 2 hour scope of work they gave me at the estimate. \nI had an apt. for my own job at 1 pm, that should have been no problem, and could not be cancelled. I called our sales rep at Roadrunner Glass to tell him I had been pushed out and had to be somewhere at 1pm. His response was that they would not be done by 1 PM(due to their issues, not mine). \nHis solution was that I could cancel the apt and get back on the schedule sometime next week. Not to reschedule that afternoon, or the next day, but just whenever they could do it. I was without a shower until this was done. They seemed more than happy to push me out to whenever the next most convenient time for them was.To be honest it's just the total lack of concern for the customer and my schedule that gets them a poor review here. This review is based on customer service and their total lack of concern if something goes wrong on their end. This review is not for poor workmanship and quality.

They wouldn't even make the appointment and that is what upset me!\nDear Margaret,\nI have spoken to the three women who interacted with you last Friday morning and on Sunday evening. To a person they describe your behavior as rude and belligerent. The packet you were mailed last October was quite explicit in stating that you are required to submit a copy of your child's birth certificate in order to have your daughter baptized. This is in accord with diocesan policy, and is in place for a variety of reasons. We do not deviate from this policy.\nIn that you appeared in the office on Friday morning, it is obviously not out of the question for you to also stop by your safety deposit box to retrieve the certificate. As Judy told you on the phone, we are quite flexible in arranging for baptism appointments that meet the needs of the parents, and will be happy to do so with you. Having all the requested information in hand at the time of your appointment ensures that everything is in order for your child's baptism. Our goal is to serve the needs of our parishioners as best we can, but we also rightly expect some cooperation from them as well. We will be happy to work with you and your husband to arrange for the baptism of your daughter and will set up an appointment at your convenience once you submit her birth certificate. I do not believe this is too much to ask.\nI am copying this email to Fr. Diskin at the diocese.\nRev. James Turner\nSt. Thomas More Catholic Church\n6180 West Utopia Road\nGlendale, Arizona 85308-7111","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},
