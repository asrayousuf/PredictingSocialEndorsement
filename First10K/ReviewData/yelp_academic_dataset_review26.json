We rented the 3 Rivers Party Bus for the Luke Bryan concert July 22nd. The problems were as follows:\n\n1. They showed up late to pick us up. Not just a couple minutes late, but 30 or so minutes, which then led them to be late for the two other stops.\n2. Half of the amenities that came with the bus, just weren't any good\/didn't work.\n   a. Speakers didn't work\n   b. TV didn't work\n   c. Poles in the middle were rusted\n   d. Bus in general was just dirty\n3. Driver wasn't pleasant at all. He was ignorant to some of the people on the bus. He also was talking poorly about our group because we weren't feeding him (We would have, if he wasn't ignorant to our group)\n4. On the way home, we were going so fast, that when the driver hit a bump on the road, we would fly out of our seats. This might be ok for some, but not us.\n5. Finally, they charged my friends Aunt an extra $400 just recently. \n\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.

The place was very packed as it's apparently the popular place during spring training. Hubby ordered steak. It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality. The guy did remove my hubby's steak dinner from the bill so that was good and we appreciated that. We did pay fifteen dollars for the baked potato and my side salad (our table had 18% gratuity added) but I was grateful to not have to pay for his entree.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My girlfriend and I have been eating at this pizza joint for a little while now, and we really did enjoy the food.\n\nHOWEVER; One night we order pizza for a party that we were having. Online it told us that we would receive our pizza at 1:15. We waited and waited until it finally hit 1:30. We then started to call the business to see where our order was. But to no avail, because no one ever answered the phone. BTW I was still charged for the food.\n\nSo the next day I called the store at 11AM (an hour after advertised opening time) and again, no one answered. I then called again that same day at 4PM and asked for a manager. The manager told me that \"They are short employees on Monday nights\" and that he saw my order in the morning and was going to void it out for me. \\\n\nNow me also working in the food business, I decided not to give the guy a hard time. \n\nBut today. (3 days later) I checked my account and found that the charge still went thru!\nSo again I called them today at 12AM and again NO ANSWER. I even went as far as to call the pluming store that is right next to Oliveos and they told me that no one was there and that I should waste my time coming down in person to complain.....\n\nSo here I am $20.88 Short, with no fricking pizza and no refund.\n\nHopefully the owner sees this and messages me so I can tell him how to run a business.\n\np.s.

I went in and talked to a woman named Susan. She was very nice and helpful, however when the negotiating started she totally shut down and acted more annoyed than interested in making a sale. Secondly we settled on a price until I noticed that my taxes for a Veloster were almost $4000!!!!! There is no way taxes should be that high!! They then said that the taxes were high because the ADDED the price for my trade-in AFTER they already SUBTRACTED the value of the car. Essentially, making my trade-in $0. After I confronted them about this, they said \"oh yeah thats weird\" and then changed the taxes to $2500, which would be fine...... If they didn't add the $1500 into a section titles \"OTHER FEES\"..... they are liars who try to jip you out of money. \n\n      After all that chaos we were able to settle on another total because of me knowing that they tried to rip me off. At this point i think, \"ok maybe all dealerships do this\" and I didn't respond to the red flags. I went to financing where I was told I could be financed. Signed all my paperwork and left with the title saying %8.99. \n\n     The next day I returned to the dealership to receive the detailing for the car because it was out in the rain. I give Susan the car and she runs into the car and proceeds to go get it cleaned. After 50 minutes or so, she comes running after me saying, \"WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!! HOW COULD YOU HIT SOMEONE!!\". I was bewildered at this point. She went in the back and ran into another dealership car and then tried to BLAME it on me. Simply pathetic. They got everything buffed out and it was not noticeable so I just wanted to leave. \n\n     After having the car for six days, they call me back one morning and say \"Oh, well, your rate has changed to 17%; pay it or bring the car back. No sympathy at all. These people are scammers, cheaters, and lairs.\n\n     It's been 2 weeks and Mark, in the financial department has YET to give me my down payment money back.

The prices are amazing -- especially coming from NYC. ALSO- in NYC, TRX is all the rage EVERYWHERE. It's the new pilates-- the results are AMAZING. It's awesome that this studio offers it. \n\nI highly recommend taking classes here!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Well i did the measurements and it would.  They spoke spanish to each other.  All of the sudden the refrigerator was damaged and the did not let me see it. Delivered another on Sunday.    Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.  Guess what it was not fixed and seriously another repeat, no call for time just got off after an 1.5 hour time, mostly hold and transfers.  No time again.

I have been going to Golden Apple for years.  Usually I wait 10-15 minutes at each appointment, which is bad enough, but this time was the worst.  For this last appointment, I was asked to come in 10-15 minutes early to complete new paperwork due to management or ownership change, I wasn't clear on the reason.  Anyway, I arrived early as requested, completed my paperwork and was shown to the procedure room on time.  I should say that the receptionist was unsmiling and bordering on rude.  In addition, the person who showed me to the room was not knowledgeable and evasive with my two or three questions, telling me to ask the doctor on each of them.  Thirty minutes later, no one had come to inform me of a reason for the delay, or an estimate of how much longer the wait would be.  In fact, I thought I was forgotten.  So I went to the receptionist, who informed me that the doctor was with a new patient and should be finished any minute.  No apology, or even acknowledgment of my inconvenience; in fact, her attitude was almost to the effect of feeling bothered.  After returning to the room and waiting another 5-8 minutes, I left after being at my appointment for more than 50 minutes.  I had rearranged my work day and simply did not have time for the procedure, especially since I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait.  In my opinion, Dr. Figueroa and the staff at Golden Apple do not respect their patients' time, or at least that of their existing patients.  New patients, beware.  I certainly hope Golden Apple does not have a policy to charge for missed appointments.  That would be a joke considering the disrespect they show their existing patients through the complete lack of regard for their time.  I highly advise trying one of the many other medical spas in the West Valley.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

LOL.  \n\nThen we discussed the outtake and how it was not code, which he didn't agree with me even though other furnace people and an inspector had stated so.  after many phone calls to the engineer, it finally came around to yes, it was against code.  the engineer had to be researching it as well.  with every phone call, he kept getting closer to what i had already determined.  but of course it was code back when they installed it.  I beg to differ.  but that's for another day.  \n\nthen they also said that cutting the intake pipe just above the ceiling is common practice.  allowing all the crap, dust, mice, etc. to fall into the intake pipe.  most furnace people tell me they have never seen it cut off above the ceiling.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BULLCRAP.  \n\nNEVER USE THESE PEOPLE!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Rob speaks of not knowing what he's getting in too in some people's vehicles(his words) I agree. He did make a complement of the rear DVD player and how good of quality it was before it broke tho. He claims he tested it after he broke it?. Lol. I had to buy a new one as the ribbon was ripped out and  unfixable.   As for the dash left loose on the friday....... Nicki robs wife and the installer odie who did the work sure were surprised when I went back in to tell them about it.... No mention of that.  My new installer said 3 out of 4 clips were missing no big deal. Why would you ever leave someone dash loose for a weekend ? Either stupid or lazy falls into this category.  But moving forward. Again not his fault, but it's His NOT GIVE A Sh@t attitude is what bugged me the Most. I understand things happen I'm a contractor,  things happen and it sucks when they do. but his (I'm the boss of this place and I don't care attitude)  should keep everyone away from there. I'm not unreasonable, bad things happen. I would have bought one hopefully at cost or something but no.  So that's the loose dash and broke rear DVD player covered. \nOn to the remote starter....... My new guy said the remote start was wired backwards or something (positive\/negative something or other) and that's probably why it wouldn't start with a key and when he took out the old remote start he wired it to something wrong and crossed something a rookie mistake as he put it. As for the marker lights again....... My hummer was brought up from the states just for me. I know rob wants to hide behind Nikki's Avalanche saying its the same wireing but I'm afraid he is wrong again. My buddy has a 07 hummer also and his lighting system works as it should with the turning knob on the dash to turn his lights on and off at leisure (day or night) but yes it has drl's but not it park.  My lighting switch was useless to me after my ROAR experience as it was impossible to turn my lighting system off at night( in park, emergency break on, tried everything). On is on and that's it. Never mind that little turn knob. That's just there for show as far as roar is concerned and I'm full of BS because Nikki's avalanche is the same way. In robs defence he did install the same remote start in it as is in my hummer so I could see why Nikki's Avalanche doesn't work too. Do they have anything in common ? don't know, Or was it his hack job talking out the old remote start ? Still didnt know. Thank goodness my new installer has figured out all of roars mistakes and hack job taking out the old remote and got me back on track.(at a cost of course)  \nSo that's the remote and lights out of the way now. Let's move on to the smoking in my ride. Like I said I'm a contractor... I know what cigarette smoke smells like and what soldering smells like. But I guess he has to defend him self by saying something. I think most people know now a days what cigarette smoke smell like. \nAs for guaranteeing there work. Yea as long as you don't come back. Lol. \nAs for the video ! Let's see it! Post it on YouTube. The last five minutes UNCUT ! From me walking back in and asking for my keys back, To me and my wife leaving. Lol Rob and myself both know, Nikki more than Rob but still Rob was freaking out yelling about how nothing is his fault and remember I was such a nice guy I even offered to buy the harness Rob was freaking out about he had to special order in and he wouldn't sell it to me because they were so mad and yelling ! In robs comment to my comment he said it was unprofessional of them not to sell it to me.( because they were freaking out) Makes you wonder now doesn't it.  Once they freaked out My wife did raise her voice for a minute over the alleged kill switch they lied about. I would love to see the video and audio. Show everyone how crazy mad they were and how calm I was.  We all know that he will never leave a YouTube address to it on Yelp or text it to me and I'll do it, because he's lying again.   But remember if you do UNCUT ! People like Rob at Roar like to say all sorts of things, but back it up with the video and audio ? Won't happen. \n\nAgain. Don't walk away from Roar Truck and Auto Accessories.....RUN. \n\nI don't expect a response this time. \n\nOne last thing, because I'm the honest one here, They did text me (real professional) to say the remote was in a week and a half later, after I bought another one. Unfortunately I could not be the one to pick it up and show roar my lights working. But you win some you loose some.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2},

I was so excited when I found out that there was a new yoga studio so close to my house. Bought a trial one month package and was only able to attend a few times. First of all the studio itself is tiny. The bare walls and windows  create an echo, which is super irritating. Secondly, the infrared light smack in the middle of the room either roasts you to an uncomfortable temperature or you barely get any heat if you're  in the perifery  of the room. Thirdly, although there are a few scheduled  classes during a day they require you to sign up through mind and body to be able to attend, and make sure that there's a teacher there. So if you find a minute to come in without signing up ahead of time , there's a good chance they won't be open, unless some other student signed up already. Lastly, from the few classes that I actually got to attend, the teachers  seemed a bit disjointed.  There was no real \"flow\"from posee to pose. Bottom line, the studio is too new and needs to work out a LOT of kinks.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Decor from decades ago, but the place was clean.\n\nOrdered coffee $2.15 (got one top up) and \"Eggs\" which was 3 eggs with potatoes. The price after breakfast hours was $8.45  . The Eggs and Sausage was $10.45, comes with 4 links of sausage.  When the toast came out, it was glistening in good ole butter!  The way I used to butter my toast when i was a kid! \n\nFriendly service.  But like the other reviews said, fairly pricey for such a basic breakfast.  It is a place you want to try out at least once to say you've done it and then maybe come back after a few years for the novelty. . Although for nostalgia, I hope the place does stay open for many more years to come.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The worst- is the amount of children roaming lobby, halls, strollers everywhere....I love kids and if you have them-this may be a fantastic place for you to stay...because it is a lot like one giant day care center.

I would not waste a penny on food at this place- ordered room service breakfast---$40 and it was awful.  Had a grilled cheese sandwich- $13 at the cafÃ© and it was burnt and had one slice of store bought sliced cheese on it...AWFUL.  Do not waste any money on food here.

Another very annoying detail....if you are going to have security ask you for your room key each time you enter the elevator bank---EDUCATE them.  Let's see ---I was at a business conference in the Vdara, so in and out of the room several times a day.

Obviously, I wasn't going to pay that much for a small problem, so I called another company called ANTA plumbing. Even their technician arrived in an hour and was extremely professional and estimated $465 before taxes for the same problem.  He was kind enough to break down the cost for me.

They said it would be ready in 2-5 days. 2 weeks later still nothing. The guy said he would travk it down and call me back. No return call. On my third call back he threatened me with violence and said to come down to see what a man I was. This was followed by extremely harsh language and more threats.  I'm a fairly calm guy and not easily offended but I have never in my life come across anything like this.   Give this place a very big miss.  Single most aggressive evil unhinged service ever'!!  Needless to say I never got the glass. Still trying to get the owner on the phone","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

She pays attention to detail, is professional, and caring. I moved from out of state and was worried about finding a good dentist, but the staff immediately made me feel at home. They have even been able to squeeze me in for some dental emergencies. I recommend her to all my friends and would never go anywhere else.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Mature place where you don't have to worry about a shooting or \"hood\" crowd. Very sexy and sophisticated place. Free vodka drinks. Call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines.

Their Beet and Goat Cheese salad is amazing and actually quite filling.\n3 stars because:\n-the customer service is quite poor, no one is particularly friendly or helpful, a lot of the time one will direct you to another staff member, who will just stare at you until you talk\n-the food is very pricey for the portion size\n-the line-up area is very confusing; if you just go in for a coffee and go right up to the till, there's a moment of awkward limbo between you and a someone who is waiting for their food to be plated, but is ready to pay.\nAfter visiting Paris last fall, it was neat to come home and see Brioche, as it is like 'the Starbucks of Paris'.  They do prepare the food almost in the exact same way, which was quite nostalgic.  Over all, very tasty, but could use a bit of work!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The staff at the new retail store are always really nice and helpful, you can tell they really love dogs.  My little furry gal is very finnicky, and they were able to help me find a treat that she loves- she actually waits for one every time we come in from a walk!  \n\nShe can be a difficult little lady to groom, I've never been able to do much more than brush her, but the groomers at Spaw have never voiced a complaint.  When I called to book her fist groom, I was disappointed that they day I originally wanted was booked up, but I was offered a Sunday appointment instead, which actually worked better with my schedule (it's so hard to find a weekend groomer!).  When I brought her in, I was able to meet with the groomer and go over exactly the cut I was looking for.  Initially, the cut I had asked for was better suited for a different type of dog (I brought in a picture I found online), but the groomer explained to me a better-suited 'hairstyle', and the end result was fantastic.  The couple grooms I've had since then have been with a different groomer (I think her name is Megan?), but the cut has been consistently bang-on.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

When I was living and working in the area, I would stop in several times a week, usually ordering a latte.  I tried a cappuccino once- best decision ever.  Perfectly made, perfect taste and texture.  When summer came, I tried their cold brew coffee- absolutely fantastic!  I love the lemon, a touch I would have never though of!  Anyone who is heading north, I always suggest they stop in.
