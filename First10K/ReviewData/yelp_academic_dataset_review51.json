I won't bother going to any \"chain\" salon (Supercuts, Sport Clips, etc) because they will jack up your hair. I've been bouncing around other barber shops and they are hit or miss. Bob's Barber Shop will NOT jack up your hair, and they are the only barber shop I will go to now. \n\nI've been there twice now, and received a fade from two different barbers (Zach and another fellow) and both times I was extremely impressed. The fade was smooth and gradual. They finished my neck off with a razor and warm shaving cream. The price was $13 ($12 for seniors) and I think that's pretty cheap nowadays, especially considering the service and quality of the haircut I received. \n\nIn summary, I'm glad to have finally found a barber shop that I can trust, and I would definitely recommend it to friends.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Butter chicken was bland and the beef in my vermicelli didn't taste fresh. Even the spring rolls were a bit off. Giving them a 2 star hoping it's just an off night they were having.

I really didn't appreciate the way I was treated by the lady that answered the phone when I called the shop for questions and quote request. I've dealt with many other shops on similar matters but nothing as bad.\n\n I'm a freelance designer, and one of my clients was a non-profit so part of my job was to produce material at the lowest cost possible. I mentioned that we'd like to get stuff printed, would like to get a quote for the job and also asked if they offer discounts\/sponsorship for registered charities (Many print shops have community sponsorship programs, or offer at least a 15% discount to charities). Before I was able to finish, she simply blurted out \"Hold on, I'll transfer you to the person that deals with this stuff\" and then transferred me to, guess what, her own voicemail. And of course I never got a call back. \n\nI understand \"solicitation\" calls\/emails can be annoying. But not all are with bad intentions and I always stay polite and professional and make it clear from the start that we are not simply asking for freebies, but a honest quote so we can compare prices, just like everybody else would. I believe good customer service is to treat all potential patrons with the same courtesy, not just the ones that already have a chunk of bills in their hands. A simple but respectful \"Sorry, we are not interested at this time\" or \"Unfortunately we cannot accommodate\" or even just provide me with the quote that I asked for as a potential paying customer would have sufficed. Any of the above options would have taken  a few seconds and wouldn't have ruined someone else's afternoon. So, word of advice to businesses alike - things like that stick. I won't be considering this place for my future printing needs.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Being in the service industry myself, I just let that one go./  A while later, my friends and I ordered another beer, they ordered darker beers and I ordered the lighter style (which I might add, is just as tasty as the more hearty styles).  Upon returning with the beer-- the \"friendly\" server proceeded to tell us (in the same condescending tone)  that I ordered the beer for \"People that dont like beer\".  Is it just me, or should a server not bash the product he is selling--especially at the place the product is made???  Its been a week and i am still confused by this guy.

It wasn't that the place felt dirty, just worn out. I know its hard for a place to keep its character and heritage after being spruced up, but I think they could do a little that would make a big impact.\n\nHaving said that, I do see myself spend more time here.

It was my first time going and I was not too sure what to expect. The event is a combination of music, dancing, food and drinks. There are a number of food stations throughout the ROM all featuring local, food truck style offerings. We did four or five of them, from tacos and Japanese style fried chicken to ice cream sandwiches (the best!) and apple pie. \n\nThe drinks are all $6 and the beer\/wine selection is not great, but good enough I guess. I would have preferred to see some local beers, but Perroni is obviously a sponsor.\n\nThe main dance floor is on the first level. The DJ was pretty good when we got there, but by the end of the night they had switched to a live rock band which was not as conducive to dancing. The stage on the second floor had a great band from Montreal. If you go make sure to check the schedule and plan which acts you want to see.\n\nAs others have said, make sure you buy tickets online first. It gets cold fast waiting in line if you don't have tickets. Also make sure to stock up on the ROM bucks so you don't have to waste time in line buying more all night.\n\nIn terms of the crowd it is a real mix of older and younger, people dressed to go clubbing and others in pretty casual clothes. My advice is to dress up more than less, but either way you will fit in.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

When we got there that was not the case. We had to wait for about 20-30 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us and then when they did they gave us the keys to test drive the car, alone- not telling us a single thing about the car. When we got back from the test drive we were met with a sales guy who finally told us a little about the car and agreed it had some quirks (Messed up leather seat, no backup camera, odd controls but this was a Volvo and they are a Nissan dealership so we didn't question him too much)\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of looking around in the car we decided to start the negotiation ( we had been looking for this particular car and so it didn't take much for us to decide). We headed inside to start the process. \n\nWe started our offer low- who doesn't at a car dealership and they were \"offended\" and didn't think they could make it work. After back and forth we decided to walk away from the car. They were rude and basically impossible to work with so we decided to leave and were ok with finding another car to avoid working with them. \n\nThe next day they sent me 2 texts and called me several times \"wanting to make things work\" so we offered 23,500 ALL CASH and we would pick up the car within a matter of hours (the car was listed at 23,339 + tag and fees which totaled 24,400). After getting no where with them because they didn't budge on price after calling me and wanting to make it work we offered 24,000 all cash (we are now 400 dollars apart) and they said no...\n\nI finally said forget it because they were so rude and disrespectful but they KEPT CALLING ME offering 24,300 and then 24,200- At this point I was so offended that they came down 100 dollars and I said heck no and walked away.\n\nIn summary, I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone. They are rude, disrespectful, condescending and not willing to work with the customer. It was not so much about the money for us and we found a better car and paid more for it in order to avoid working with Modern Nissan of Lake Norman.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Additional charges may apply for some requests. For accommodation preferences for the physically challenged, please call us at 1-800-CAESARS.\"\n\nI had no choice but to except that - BUT I don't understand, if I'm booking a specific room I should get what I paid for.\nThen, I asked for the crib (which was obviously not ready in our room) and I was told I need to pay for it.\n***On the phone call that I made earlier no one told me about the rooms not being available nor that I have to pay for the crib!***\n\nI told the guy at the front desk, that if I am not getting the king size beds I should not pay for the crib. Eventually he said that he will not charge me for it.\n\nIn addition, he suggested that we will switch to a king size room the day after (Saturday), and to expect a voice mail from the registration desk.\nNo need to mention that no one called us or contact us in any way and we never got the king size beds.\nThe first night was quiet and calm.\nThe second night, 3am a cloud of cigarette smoke took over our room.\nA group of young people were partying in the next room. Doors were slamming, people were shouting and cursing all over.\nAnd then - my 17 months old baby woke up coughing! The smoke was so dense as if someone was standing next to our beds and smoking in our faces!\nTo remind you, we asked for a NON-SMOKING room, which I assume will be placed on a non-smoking floor, or am I wrong?\nIt is unacceptable to me that my baby will wake up coughing in the middle of the night because the room is full of smoke - after I paid for a non-smoking environment. \nIn addition, my parents were in the next room - experiencing that exact smoke experience. My mother just recovered from cancer, and this is a health hazard for her.\nI would recommend to change the air filters because when comparing this hotel to others (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, Wynn, New York New York, and many more) - this is the hotel with the worst cigarette smell in the lobby. \nThe only good experiences we had are the pool and the \"House Hash a Go Go\" restaurant.\nWe are extremely disappointed from this experience, and will make sure to share it with our family, friends, and colleagues.\n\n\nHere is their response:\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to write and for making us aware of your experience at Rio Las Vegas.

Well, \"No\". Inadvertently, perhaps. Certinally the staff feel confident their handling of the dogs which they attend to are in excellent care. Again, perhaps. However, please see for yourself before dropping your loved ones off for a week or even a day. I encourage you to download Camp Bow Wows app before you decide. \nMy wife was going on vacation. Trying to consider my long hours at work she took it upon herself to book our two dogs at the Westlake Ohio location. Unfortunately , she failed to do her homework. So, I decided to watch the live feed to see if my dogs were okay. After two days of watching twenty plus dogs in a \"bull-pin\" type in closed area with a small outside area which didn't offer any real grass or enough room to run, excersise , or simply play. I also noticed there were no toys. As I continued to watch, there was no human interaction. Family pets obviously need human interaction. The dogs were not being walked nor were they being taken outside for bathroom breaks and probably because it is  easier to mop a tiled floor opposed to cleaning artificial grass carpet. Also, I noticed one of the male staff members was sitting on this small landing of sorts in the center of the room. As the dogs were coming over to him for attention he would bat them away. This recording was on 7 \/24\/17 in the small pet area. These dogs sit in this room within an open warehouse. The \"bull-pins\" are sectioned off into groups of size and or tempermant as far as I understood. These dogs sit in this room by the door waiting within an atmosphere of very loud constant barking. \nIn my opinion, this place isn't good. I felt sorry for the dogs there when I nearly sped as fast as I could to rescue my two boys. After two days of watching the live feed, it was all I could take. Ask yourself. \" How can you expect your bet to rest without nervousness amongst constant loud barking. Camp Bow Wow distracts the reality as they use \"Camp\" as well as their \"cute\" play on words relating to \"k9', pet, dog and puppy. Notice when the dogs are out of the \"bull-pins\". There will be a memo stating the dogs are asleep from a busy day. Really? Your dog doesn't need a \"Camp\". They need attention, human interaction, behavioral  enforcement, bathroom breaks, walks. Most of all, \"A family setting\". \nWatch for yourself on Camp Bow Wows live feed. In my opinion. It is sad.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},
