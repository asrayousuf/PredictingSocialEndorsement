I will add that I have never in my life had a hairdresser who was so caring and concerned about understanding what I want for my hair, then working to give it to me and 'get it right.' Christian is a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel as if my appoinments with her are also  visits with a friend. \n\nNot to mention that she is a kick-ass, super-talented stylist and my hair has never looked better!

Much of it stems from the fact that these apartments were built in the late 80's \/ early 90's and haven't kept up with the times. My apartment had a leaky A\/C unit which would freeze up and drip down onto the carpet. That's exactly what you want during Arizona summers. I changed my air filter often, but the air vents are old and dirty and made me have respiratory problems. Management loves to provide little input or real change and instead just sends the maintenance guys who are able to do little to nothing for these old, troubled rental units.\n\nBesides the units themselves, as I mentioned you'll get problems from management to add to it. Nothing topped off a day at work like coming home to see a note on my door that our entire building will have the water shutoff tomorrow starting at 5am until 5pm. I think this is just a little bit of short notice in the instance of \"routine maintenance.\" I recall this happened at least three times, and once was actually due to the old pipes freezing up during a cold winter. Then when it came time to move out, it was a hassle and negotiation for my full deposit to be returned when it was due to existing problems, and they're making zero investment to renovate and remodel these old apartments. \n\nI understand you want to be near Old Town, but you can do better.","useful":9,"funny":0,"cool":1},

The curry was described as \"very mild\" but was spicier than the sweet\/hot thai dish which was described as \"spicy\".

The wine\/beer list is varied, looks well curated, and is not overpriced (though not cheap). I had half-sweet tea which was a bit more tannic and less sweet than I would have expected, but still good. My wife had a good bottled cider. The pretzel sticks before the meal are a cute touch, and they work well.\n\nWe skipped appetizers, though we tried some of the lobster mac-n-cheese that a friend ordered and it was good.\n\nFor our entree we each ordered a steak, the spinalis (medium) for myself, and a filet (rare) for my wife. The spinalis is a tough cut to cook right, so the slight overdoneness can be forgiven, but it was also over seasoned and poorly trimmed. The steak sauce with which it was served is very one-dimensional, and did not pair well with the arugula\/parmesan garnish at all. Would avoid the sauce if you want to taste the beef. My wife's filet (ordered rare) was medium-rare at the thicker end of the cut --yes, a filet with a thicker end-- and was medium\/medium-well at the thinner end. This imparted a chalky mouthfeel to what should have been a silky cut of beef.\n\nMy steak was served with fries, though I asked for the truffle-parm fries. The fries were a sad portion, with a few full-length fries that were cooked right, and the rest of the portion looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the fry-basket --short and burnt. The truffle oil was applied too liberally and smelled almost scorched. My wife's steak was served with yukon gold mashed in a cast iron skillet, and they were moist and delicious. Would recommend the potatoes to other patrons.\n\nI had opportunity to try the dessert paired with the prix-fixe vegetarian meal, which was a chocolate-and-berries cup with whipped cream. The cream was delicious and a great pairing in general, though the chocolate hunks should have been cut smaller - they were three-bite size.\n\nI imagine that you can have a delicious meal at Zink, but when you're not precise with temperature, lack delicacy with seasoning, and are missing some small but noticeable details, it shows. If I were to return I would stick to easy-to-execute and more forgiving dishes like a burger.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0},

The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.\n\nWe then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).\n\nThen on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.\n\nWe had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.\n\nThe salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.\n\nNext was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.\n\nThe third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare\/medium, but mine was perfect.\n\nNext, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese\/nut\/fruit\/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.\n\nLastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said \"this is how cheesecake should be served\", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Additionally, her vehicle was towed from the premises in error and subsequently damaged in the process - courtesy of the towing company hired by The District.  The District had been paid for our daughter to lawfully park there and did nothing to resolve the matter when the serious problem presented itself.  Our daughter was forced to be late to her place of employment as well as to make arrangements to retrieve her vehicle from the tow yard.  Finally, we knew that we were dealing with unscrupulous individuals at the District and therefore, made sure to request a physical walk through at the end of her lease this past July '16.  A maintenance representative walked the unit in our presence and provided a written receipt that the unit was in good condition \"no damages\".  This week, more than 75 days later, we receive a bill from the District for apparent damages that have since been found.

I only ate half of my steak. \n\nThey offered nothing for the inconvenience, no free desserts or discounts on the meal. Just a sorry. \n\nWe made reservations at 7:45pm.
