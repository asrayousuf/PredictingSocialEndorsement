Fortunately they don't have that Gold Peak ( aka gold piss) crap that a lot of restaurants have in Maryland. I love brewed tea.... So we ate outside at one of the tables. There are only about 3-4 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go. Overall, a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap.

Because it was a big area that was very overgrown, it took a 2-3 days, but the goats absolutely cleared everything out.  \n\nThe goats can't clear everything out like weed killer, but the most they left were a few small weeds sticking a few inches out of the ground.  We were very surprised how well it worked.  \n\nAlso, the area where the goats were focused was along the bank of a lake and we weren't sure how the goats would do, because a lot of the poison ivy was very close to the water.

The resort fee is an additional $14.95 per night. I waited until 11am to check in.\n\nThe resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedly...I believe it's just a way for the hotel to make more money.\n\nWhen I did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when I only paid for 4 nights through price line. I had to correct her by showing her my price line paperwork.\n\nI used cash for $100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under $60.\n\nThey tried to put me in a handicapped room (don't know why) but I requested a regular room instead.\n\nDuring check in if you don't correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room. I still ended up with a really bad room.\n\nThe room I had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall. The bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff. I tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work. The bathroom sink had hair in it. The carpet looked old dingy and dirty.\n\nThe entire room reeked of cigarette smoke.\n\nThe buffet was bad.....for some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap.  Dinner cost $12. \n\nI didn't complain to management about my experience at the hotel I didn't think they would do anything about it......according to the other reviews I read.\n\nIt's a cheap ran down smelly hotel.....at least I wasn't double charged. It's not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Most restaurants would have let something as simple as me deciding to change my mind from pick up to dine in GO. Especially when I spent about $20 on two sandwiches. pretty sure I won't ever go back there again. Besides they gave me a cold cornbeef sandwich. The Swiss cheese was not even melted, and the worst part about it all they don't put mustard on the sandwich. It could have been handled better.

It's clean, and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town, but if you ever travel outside of Vegas, you'll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better.

I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for\/budget\/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses \/ accessories very soon.  :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people.
