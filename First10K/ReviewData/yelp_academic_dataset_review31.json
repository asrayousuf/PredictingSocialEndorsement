The vet is so careless and not good at all.\nIt makes you feel that the doctor only cares about your money, not your pet.  A few weeks ago,  I brought my cat in, she recommended to go through all kinds of unnecessary expensive tests. When it really comes to some issues, she had no ideas what should be done. She did some physical check on my cat without finding out any wound or  real reason causing the problem. Then My mom went back home and found some wounds.

The new buns or way they cook the buns is so far off what it used to be. And these burgers are tiny, why are they more than a regular sized McDonalds Cheeseburger. A normal guy, i used to get 4. On a late night after the bars, most of my buddies and i would get 6. Not any more. So the burgers aren't as great, again somethings different about the bun, and the Price almost doubled....oh and the service. The wait staff didn't have that many tables, and its small in there, so its not like you could have more than 4 tables per person. Slow service, and even if there was a waitress next to you and you wanted to pay or wanted help, good luck getting their attention. \n\nReally let down.

Just ditched them and I couldn't be happier. Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind.

The food was another story. My husband and I decided to go with the Easter dinner menu (three courses, $25 per person). Our appetizers arrived with our food. Disappointing, but we didn't make a big deal aside from mentioning it to our server (her response was, \"I don't know what the kitchen was doing.\") Unfortunately, I think our apps were the best part of the meal (goat cheese medallion and fit to be tied pickled & fried). I had the southern steak frites...completely flavorless and also cold. The potato cracklins were the star of the dish which is sad. My husband had the porterhouse pork chop, which he said was \"just ok.\" Dessert was also just ok. I left feeling like I should have gone to Cracker Barrel where I could've had mediocre food and biscuits for half the price (no offense to CB). There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte, I doubt we will be back to waste our time and money here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We have a friend in Montreal who was able to get us a reservation at this restaurant.  We were very excited to be able to eat here during our trip.  We had an 830 reservation and we walked from our hotel not that far away.  We arrived about 20 minutes early and we were told we could sit and have a drink at the bar.  When we approached the bar to sit the bartender asked if we had \"permission\" to sit at the bar, which i thought was kind of strange.  After informing him that we did have \"permission\", he asked us what we would like to drink.  Two of us ordered a Pinot Noir and one ordered a mixed drink.  We sat chatting until our table was ready.  The waitress was very nice but must have been very busy that evening because she was slow coming to the table.  We ordered another round of drinks.  When she came back she poured a different wine and we told her we had the Pinot Noir.  She came back to the table and told us that they didn't have any Pinot Noir that evening and wasn't sure which wine the bartender had given us. They finally figured it out and it wasn't what we had even asked for originally.  We decided to just have the original wine and let it slide being we were so excited to be there.  We ordered the Lobster Poutin to start and also placed our dinner orders.  We were served bread thankfully because it took forever to get the Poutin which the three of us ate in no time because the portion (and we ordered the meal size) was quite small.  We had to cut the lobster pieces on top so that the three of us would at least get some lobster.  We sat talking and waiting for dinner for a very long time.  Finally the food came out and we started to eat.  The waitress then came over and kept trying to clear dishes while we were eating.  We finished up dinner and were waiting for the waitress to come back to give us the desert menu but that didn't happen.  A male came over and put a small piece of cheesecake down and said this is on the house and could we please hurry because they needed our table!!! Are they kidding me.  It was not our fault that they took so long serving us dinner but now they didn't offer us a desert menu or coffee and they throw our one small desert for 3 people and ask us to hurry so they can have the table.  We paid the overpriced bill and left and got our coffee elsewhere.  Not happy was an understatement.  Overpriced, small portions, slow service (until they need your table), never offered a dessert and coffee menu.... We ate at much better restaurants during our week long trip...","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The sleeves and shoulder needed to be taken in, but it was not my main concern. I wanted the dress hemmed so the inner slip landed on my ankle, with the outer layer resting on the top of my foot. I took it in Monday, asking if it being done by Saturday would be a problem. I was told that it would be close, but no. It would be fine. \n\nI had to go back in on Tuesday so the main seamstress could see what I needed done. After waiting 10 minutes for him to meet me there (he said be there at noon and he was very late), he seemed very mad at me for making him go in. I got the sense he was not interested in this job and definitely not in the customer. He removed all of the pins from the previous day and put in ONE pin on the inner slip. I asked if he needed more and he grumbled no. He would hem both pieces up using the one stitch as a guide. He also pinned the sleeves and shoulder. I showed him the image of the dress several times so he could get a reference of where it needed to fall. \n\nI never got a call back, so 6 hrs before I needed the dress, I called and found out it was done. I tried it on and to my dismay, the bottom was not done. If it was, I could not tell as both slips were still inches on the floor and I could still not walk in it! The 2 workers there were very nice. They tried to figure out what to do. I wound up getting some temporary stitching that pulled the dress up about 4 inches. I overheard them say that since I was so polite and didn't raise my voice, cuss or yell at them, that I should get some form of discount as the dress was not done properly.\n\nThey insisted (I offered many times to pay) I take the dress without paying and they would have the owner call me on Monday to work out a discount. When she called, she sounded very mad about it. It took a few tries to explain why I left the store without paying and then she told me in an extremely stern voice \"You know, you still have to pay.\" Ummm. Yes. I know. I told her the girls were the ones who suggested a discount and she said I just needed to come in and have the guy do the stitching in a permanent way and discuss the dress with him. I don't need the dress again, or to speak to such a rude person again, so no thanks. Then she spent the next few minutes complaining about how her worker isn't going to be happy with her at all as he wont get paid. She also kept saying that he was confused about why there was only one pin (that he put in) in the dress, and that he didn't know or understand what I wanted. I reminded her that she was there when I showed him the pic, gave many explanations of what I wanted. I wasn't sure how long they needed, but Tuesday - Saturday didn't seem like it was an impossible mission. \n\nI've decided, after dealing with this all, that I am going to pay the full price because they care about some very rude employee who didn't do HIS JOB more than the customer who tried to remain polite throughout a thoroughly bad situation. At least the upper part of the dress was okay. Please do not go here!","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Unfortunately, the owners and the service I received completely ruined my experience. \n\nI was staying at a local hotel, which made reservations for our party (and I heard the concierge make the reservation). When we got to the restaurant, they first couldn't find our reservation; after waiting 10 minutes, they tried to seat the four of us at a table for two in the back corner. There was no way the four of us could fit around this small table. So, the OWNER (note: not just an employee) apologized and offered us a round of drinks on the house to make up for the delay. We were finally seated, but again the owner came over to our table to tell us that we didn't have a reservation and basically called us a liar. We asked him what he would like us to do - we already had appetizers on the table, so he told us to stay (so what was the point of him harassing us again?). \n\nThe bill came and our drinks were not taken off the bill. We called the two co-owners over and they told us we all must have misheard and that had never said anything like that. Blatant lie. He then called us liars and told us we were trying to get out of paying. He then proceeded to charge our credit cards twice, so somehow I now am paying three times what I should have been paying (since those drinks were never taken off). As a customer, I've never been treated so poorly. So, yes, the food is good, but there are equally good \/ better places out there that don't treat their customers so horribly.

We've stayed here many times before, but this last time will probably be our last. The reason we've stayed here is its location, its reasonable prices, and the room size. Every room is a suite with a double bed and a living room.\n\nUnfortunately, we were beset by what appears to be a re-structuring of the hotel's housekeeping service. Our habit is to leave for breakfast and notify the housekeeping service to make up our room while we're gone. We like to come back after lunch and nap, and hate to find them only getting around to making up our room when we're back. \n\nSo, the first day, we called at 9am, asked them to clean within the next hour. I left my wife shopping at 2pm. Guess who had just gotten started on making it up. I came back at 3, and they were gone. BUT, I found our newspapers and used glasses and coffee cups not removed. Also, the bathroom floor had some kleenex or possibly toilet paper on it. I didn't say anything then.\n\nNext day, we call again at 8:30am. Go downstairs for breakfast. I get back to the room at 10am. Room not made up. I want to do some work while my wife shops. Call housekeeping. They tell me they'll do it as soon as possible. I say when is that? She says, right away. I change my plans and go do some exploring. Get back at noon. Yep! not done. The person says they're in the middle of changing housekeeping systems and they're sorry.\n\nRoom was cleaned that evening, but we napped on dirty linens. Shouldn't happen at a first class hotel. I've stayed in many many hotels and never had that problem. While I didn't ask for some credit on my account, I expect a first class hotel to offer some sort of compensation, maybe just a credit on a future stay. Nope. Nothing. Nada.\n\nAs I said, the hotel is fine. Lots of good restaurants, good location, great rooms, if not clean. So, I will probably stay somewhere else next year. Sorry, Venetian. Two stars.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I went alone tonight. I was seated right by the kitchen even though there were other small tables in better locations. I know I could (should) have asked to be moved but I figured maybe there would be a crowd later on and when I'm alone I don't get very picky. I was apparently assigned to a busy waiter who was annoyed at having to serve me. He took my order after about ten minutes making it clear that he was in a rush. \n\nI didn't see him again except once when he refilled my soft drink. Others bring the items when they're ready. They brought out two of the three appetizers I had ordered in reasonable time. I knew the third one - the chicken wings - take 20 minutes to prepare so I waited. And waited. Didn't see my waiter. After 40 minutes the bus boy asked me if I wanted any boxes for my leftovers. I told him I still didn't have all my order. He went to check it out. Only then did my waiter come (actually about another five minutes later) to tell me it would be just a few more minutes. I told him to just forget them and bring me the check. \n\nHe seemed reluctant to do that maybe because it would reflect on his service. But he did. So, I got a pretty good albeit a pretty small meal for about ten bucks. Because I feel sorry for people who have to make a living as servers I still have him a five dollar tip. \n\nThe other problem with Flo's is that, other than a few appetizers, the rest of their dishes aren't even mediocre. \n\nThe two appetizers you should try are the shiu Mai and the chicken wings. The calamari is tasty but often too chewy.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Most of the wines are also sorted by color and density(Light Reds, Medium Reds, etc) while the rest are displayed in the rotating floor stands with labels like \"Date Night\", \"Tax Refund\" and \"Girl's Night Out\". All of the wines have cleverly written description cards next to them that are helpful in ascertaining the character of the wine.\n\nTwo wall mounted kiosks also allow you to browse the store's stock and with the recently updated software they are running, track which wines you have purchased and rate them,which is great because I cant always remember what I thought of a particular wine that I may have had a year ago. They will also give you more information about the wine you just tasted (more on that in a sec) and allow you to add wines to your wish-list should a friend or relative happen by and want to know what to bring to that party your hosting. \"Hey Mom, don't show up without a bottle of the Niepoort 20 year if you know whats good for ya!\"\n\nAnyone who drinks wine knows the sad little moment when you take a taste of a wine not yet tried and think, \"I don't like this nearly as much as root-canal.\" To combat this problem the slingers of grapes at Winestore have installed two machines imported from Italy called Enorounds, one for Whites and one for Reds that allow you to sample wines. You purchase a Winestore card, putting whatever amount of money you wish on it, insert the card into the Enoround, push a button and a sample will be poured for you by the machine. Not only does it allow you to try before you buy, it makes shopping for wine a lot more fun.\n\nWhat really makes the store stand out for me as my absolute favorite is that the owners, Matt and Keith, have taken the time to get to know me as a customer, are always willing to take the time to discuss particular wines with me and have become familiar with my tastes and will gladly recommend wines for me when asked.  For those of us that love wine, but aren't really educated on what grape is what and what region produces which to what effect, purchasing wine can be somewhat daunting. Not at Winestore. While there are a few good places to buy wine in Charlotte, Winestore is my absolute favorite.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

In this day and age, when privately owned stores with knowledgeable staffs are few and far between, it's nice to have Biggs there when I need them.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

One person's orgasmic-gourmandic experience may be another's mediocre meal. Tastes vary greatly and it all boils down to that meal at that moment in that place.That being said, if you don't find Lulu to be absolutely amazing then there is something horribly wrong with you. \n\nWe went on the friday after Thanksgiving and Charlotte must have been still under the effects of post-gobbler tryptophan malaise because when we arrived we were one of three tables, a scenario which I understand to be atypical. We were greeted warmly and seated by a window which framed a vignette of Central Ave at night. Wine was poured, conversation ensued and then the food was plunked down in front of us. My wife had the eggplant lasagna and I opted, in spite of the \"you are what you eat\" connotations, for the Chowdahead. My wife's dish was excellent, smoky and perfectly balanced taste and texturally. My Chowdahead, well let's just say the only superlative that could come close to describing it is \"wicked awesome.\" For those of you not from New England, that means phenomenal. A fillet of salmon, which was perfectly cooked, lay atop a bed of the most wonderful chowder I've had south of the Mason-Dixon line. That evening was one of the first nights with a winter chill in the air this season and these two entrees fit the weather perfectly. Hot, rich, perfectly seasoned and filling. Our waitress was great, the service excellent. It was comfort food with class, served in a warm atmosphere coupled with good wines and great service. It was, absolutely, the best meal I've had in Charlotte in years. And I hear they do brunch as well.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

I was living in an are up north that had a sizable Southeast Asian community, and there were at least six Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of my house. Not having a lot of spare cash coupled with the fact that the Vietnamese eateries were quite affordable meant that my friends and I would quite often find ourselves with bellies full of pho and vietnamese iced coffee. Fast forward many years later and I'm glad to find that there is an excellent choice for Vietnamese food a quick hop from my current abode.\n\nI've been to dine at Saigon Palace close to a dozen times and it has been consistently good. The staff has been friendly, the service great, and the food has been extremely tasting and satisfying. The Pho is quite good as is the Bun. Also, the quail appetizer is outstanding. I did manage to make it to their Sunday buffet lunch which was very cool. It was packed and the place was buzzing with families and large groups happily chowing down and enjoying the food and conversation.

A burger joint within minutes of home that didn't have a clown as its mascot? Sounded good to me. Sadly though the reality of the counter is that in 4 visits they screwed up our orders 3 times out of 4. Fairly incredible when you consider that the kitchen is working from customer filled-out checklists.\n\nOnce when we were in we were one of 3 occupied tables. The food took almost 30 minutes to arrive once ordered. Another time one of the management was at the entrance and was angrily trying to either get the attention of or berate a member of the staff. He did so by raising his hand in the air and repeatedly snapping his fingers at the staffer in full view of the entire restaurant. that sort of thing should be kept behind the scenes. It just made the manager look like an imbecile.\n\nOn my fourth and final visit I had to send back a burger that I had ordered medium-well that arrived on the rare side of medium. The waiter looked at the burger and said \"Our medium well is like that.\" Their medium-well? I was sort of flabbergasted  and simultaneously amused by the thought of arbitrary meat temperatures, it would save restaurants having to re-cook items. \"No ma'am, OUR chicken, unlike other establishments birds, are fully cooked when pink, not to worry.\" \n\nI won;t be going back, when I get a jones for a really good burger I'll drive the extra 8 minutes to Big Daddy's Burger Bar on East Blvd.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My wife swears by the fried chicken. I have danced my way around the sides though and the Yams have to be tasted to be believed. Beyond great. The mac and cheese is stellar too. This isn't \"light lunch\" fare so take my advice and come hungry and save room for dessert. They have Junior's cheesecake. Now, if you've never set foot in Brooklyn, NY that might not mean anything to you, but if you dig cheesecake give it a go.

The hostess seated us and gave us menus, and that's the last interaction we had with any employee in the 15+ minutes we sat there.  For the first several minutes we though maybe its because they were busy.  But as time went on and we were passed by numerous servers, we started to wonder if we were invisible.  For the next several minutes we amused ourselves wondering how long it would take a server to eventually come to our table, and we spent the last five minutes discussing where we were going for dinner after we left North Park Lounge.\n\nNo, we weren't in a remote corner.  We were front and center at a table that every server had to walk past to pick up their orders.  Our table was right beside the hostess station where two of them were working.  Sure, we could have gone to them and asked for a server, but that's not our job.  Besides, after waiting so long our appetite for this place had soured.  There are enough restaurants around that we don't need to help ourselves.\n\nThe purpose of a restaurant is to serve food to their customers, and this place failed us.  I have a one strike rule with restaurants.  As I said, there are plenty of restaurants, and we will opt for other places in the future rather than risk another poor experience here.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had a couch that had some pet dander on it, so I needed it cleaned. I called and got a quote for $39 for a full shampoo of the couch and ottoman, plus $15 for a stain guard, and set an appointment window for 2-4pm. At 4:15pm on the day of my appointment, I called to see where the technician was, and was told \"Oh, he's running a few minutes late, can we reschedule?\" Um....no, THIS was the time I had available. Long story short, tech doesn't turn up until 5:40. \n\nThen, he looks over the couch, tells me it will actually cost $400 to clean it, and tries to get me to sign a paper that had the total amount blank, as well as sign something stating I was happy with the service....before he had even done anything. I told him I wanted to just the cleaning I had requested and for which I was quoted, and I wasn't going to pay any more than the price I was quoted, despite his protestations of, \"But it might not look\/smell right,\" and his assurances to work with me as long as I could tell him \"what is the maximum amount you're willing to pay?\" \n\nAfter about 10 minutes of this ridiculous run around, I told him to get to it with the cleaning I requested or he could leave. It took him almost half an hour to clean it, which normally would be fine, except he was very obviously going slowly, which just annoyed me. \n\nThen, once he finished the couch, he had the audacity to begin asking me questions about my personal life, like who the people were in photos I have up in my living room, if I was seeing anyone, how long I had been in a relationship, etc. I was absolutely appalled at his behavior, from start to finish. To show up late, try to get me to pay for services I don't need or want, and then to violate my safety by hitting on me in my own home is completely unacceptable. \n\nI will NEVER use this company again, nor will I ever recommend them.

We just happened upon this restaurant--with the help of Yelp.  What an amazing experience.\n\nThe food, the ambience, the attentive staff were all wonderful.  I loved the atmosphere--it was small, intimate and cozy.  The food was amazing, sensitively handled, with subtle flavors that celebrated each dish.  The staff were very attentive and easy to converse with.  \n\nThe chefs are to be congratulated!  It was so apparent that they love to create unique experiences.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Great service and staff! Meet Dragan the bartender who was AMAZING!

Plus she was such a doll to talk too!! \n\nThe Fairmont is probably the most gorgeous resorts I've been too in the valley! I was telling my Hubs that this is what you think of when you think of a resort! It's lush landscaping, gorgeous pools & pods (those Lilly pads ) and beautiful unkept buildings! Nothing was rundown or \"old\"","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The first time was a year ago and Civil Liberties left a great impression as the bartenders crafted individualized drinks based on our descriptions of what we liked. There were about 6 of us the first time and we all loved what we got. After that first visit I was looking for a reason to come back. Went back again last week and it was as great as I remembered. I got a mezcal based cocktail and my friend ordered one of their craft beers. The drinks were great. I love the vibe of this bar. Can't wait to venture back when I'm back to this part of town.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We were just bar hopping through the neighbourhood and came across Northwood. I loved the cozy feel of the bar. Our waitress was great. I wasn't sure what to drink and she recommended a gin based drink with thyme, I think the Choupette. It was AMAZING! I go out for cocktails regularly and I must say I loved this one! My friend got a classic old fashioned which was also great! Can't wait to come back and try more cocktails!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Arrived 5 minutes early and there was already a line. Luckily I got seated right away. My friend and I ordered a latte and a ginger tea. We shared their baked eggs of the day, the rajasthani eggs and a half order of their french toast (stuffed with brie and sour cherry). My only regret was not taking a picture before I ate! The food was delicious and fresh. I loved everything we ordered. The regularly changing menu of specials will keep me coming back regularly! The meal was pretty cheap considering how much we ate! Highly recommend this place!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

Then my co workers told me I had to get the one they are know for which is the bobi I guess. N I tried it. It was still not good. N in top off it was a chopped up turkey bone in my sandwhich which scratched my throat n I almost choked on n died. N the staff wasn't nice when I walked in there was no one in line it took him 3 minutes to even look up from the grill n notice I was there.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We later found out that he was the bartender and the waiter.  Which is ridiculous the bar had about 5 people sitting there he had to serve n one lady was talking his ears off which took us forever to get our food. That wasn't his fault, it's red lobsters for being cheap and understaffed. That's the reason I took a star off other then that it was an okay visit the waiter was pleasant it just took forever. I also went here last night for the endless shrimp we got there at 9pm. We had an amazing waitress her name was Fabiola. She never let our glasses get empty , she was very nice, and she kept our shrimp coming at a steady pace. Even after 10 when the restaurant was closed she still let us order another dish. When I come back to red lobster I'm defiantly going to ask for her to be my waitress.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
