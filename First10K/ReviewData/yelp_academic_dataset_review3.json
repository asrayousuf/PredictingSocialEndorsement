The decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  Asian-inspired, as expected but also appears somewhat dated. \n\n1) Singaporean-style slaw\n\nWe ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light. \n\nThe tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.\n\nNote: there are peanuts. \n\n2) Peking & Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras pâté\n\nThis is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant style Peking duck. I didn't enjoy this very much. \n\n3) Warm Molten Chocolate Cake ($12): caramelized jackfruit & banana, vanilla bean ice cream\n\nNothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.\nAnyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.\n\nI tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.\n\nMy bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.\n\nOverall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. \n\nSo I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

NOT AT ALL \n\nKhao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it \"authentic\" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.  \n\nTom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.  \n\n\nCurry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.\n\n\nService was fast. \n\nServers were fine. \n\nMusic was fine. \n\n\n\nOverall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Almond croissant was a bit on the drier side \n\nMacaroons\nMatcha & white chocolate - had a strange fridge radiator after taste which I hated and the matcha was too mildly infused. Earl grey has a chocolate filling which is honestly, too overpowering for the bergamot notes. Red velvet also more chocolate in flavour not quite enough vanilla (maybe just the supplier). \n\nOver all there were a few I did really enjoy and would recommend, as I would select the following flavours again upon my next visit  100% Salted Carmel then, Hazelnut, Pistachio (could be a little stronger but still amazing) , Lavender, Boston cream is very true to flavour, Raspberry, and Chocolate. \n\nHonestly, the last time I came in but NOT the first three times ... but the last time .... all my macaroons had a really off putting stomach turning fridge taste. As it was the only time that happened I will he going back as I love the lavender and salted caramel macaroons ! \n\nHave yet to try the pies but they look fabulous along with the scones and meat pies.... can't try everything in one day ;)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts. \nI am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino. \n\nI love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment. \n\nThe good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them! \nThe bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! ) \n\nThe coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.\n\n\nI try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ... And it will effect me to now go closer to Bathurst and collage to go get my almond pistachio fixes from more pleasant staff.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Can't go wrong with the chicken. \n\nSteak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef.... \n\nThe fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality ?

I was not disappointed! \n\nAt first I was going to Boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings, hips and shoulders. Results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts. \n\n\nAfter my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion Boris really dedicated his time to help me. \n\nHe informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated \n\nThey do a lot of services here! It's like the one stop shop for anyone's needs! I have had Physio, massage, acupuncture, cupping, and even things on vestibular rehabilitation.

I just hope for future hires they consider always having at least one person who understands what they are selling. \n\nThe first time I went in for gold leaf paint no one was even around to help.... Out of all the floors I finally managed to find a representative on the third floor. Once I asked her where I could find it she asked me to wait because apparently she was the only person working and had 3 other people in front of me?! How can such a large store be so understaffed on a weekend morning I don't know.... I was very happy to see on my second visit that this has changed.\n\nThey now have many more reps working the floor ...unfortunately when I went to ask about some stain glass products again, I was not able to get the help I needed from the first representative....
