Watch out in finance as they will try to slip optional fees into the deal and lie about them when caught. The vehicles Infiniti makes are top notch and frankly above this low level form of selling. If you notice the additional fees after you have signed you are out of luck as they will do nothing for you after the fact. I will  never do business with them again and neither should you. My last Infiniti was purchased from Coulter in Mesa, no issues there.

Hadn't been in awhile, so I stopped in. That was a mistake. I can see now by other recent reviews that others also haven't been having favorable experiences and thats a shame. \nThe service was so bad, it was funny. \nMy party of 2 was told there was a 10 minute wait, although we could see at least 3 empty tables. The hostess disappeared and then was seen again walking past us a couple of times carrying plates. Great. They're short staffed. No actual patrons were seen leaving to \"free up\" tables. After more than 10 minutes, the hostess reappears at her area and seated us. \nIt then took more than 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at our table. Finally a very somber looking waiter comes by, rattles off a list of things he has to do and why he can't get to us right now. Wow. I should have taken the hint and left, but my companion and I were patient, in great moods and just trying to enjoy our Saturday off from our own hectic jobs. After we ordered actual lunch and handed Mr. Busy Waiter our menus, he said \"this one has to stay on the table\" and then had to take a moment to arrange and rearrange the drink menu back on the table. Wow, ok. He cared more about the drink menu, that we didn't order off of, than us since he took so much time arranging and rearranging it.\nI'm sure by this review you can tell how the rest of the meal went. Nothing was offered or explained by Mr. Busy Waiter. We were imconveniencing him by just being there. \nPretzel appetizers were dry and barely warm. Cheese was cold. When said appetizer arrived we had to ask for napkins. We were told they were a \"hot commodity today\" and Mr. Busy Waiter disapperared. Well, gee, I sure hope you can round up napkins and silverware before lunch comes. My drink never saw a proper refill with ice, so I was left drinking a diluted, warm soda. The sandwiches were sloppily assembled and seemed to have been hanging around before they were served as the tomato was warm and mushy. At this point we cut our losses and got outta there.\nI will make sure to tell others about The Liberty. If you're short staffed, don't take it out on the patrons. This restaurant and staff attitude need a serious reboot. Shame on you The Liberty!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

I wonder if our idiot neighbor is stalking us and knows we just ate at taco tijuana - s\/he is currently blasting marriachi music in a bizarre coincidence considering where we just ate... at least it isn't heavy metal....\n\nSo onto the resto review:\n\nFunky small and colourful. ... enjoyed the kitschy art adorning the walls. \n\nWe did have to wait about 20 minutes for round one (but we expected this wait based on other reviews and went when we had time) but our patience was rewarded with seriously loaded taco on soft tortilla. There are in fact 2 torrillas underneath the fresh pile of yummy.. and we found that splitting the contents between the 2 shells made them easier to eat with our hands (mmmmm).\n\nAll tacos come served on two (stacked) soft tortillas with fresh avocado, salsa verdi, (onions), and cilantro on top of the main filling. We tried the sausage with cheese, fish, pork and lamb tacos. Having read they can be a little heavy handed on cilantro and onion- I had mine without onion. They did use lots of cilantro - but I love cilantro so it didn't bother me. \n\n The fish was nicely deep fried and crispy and the texture was a nice counterpoint to the softness of the taco, avocado and salsa Verdi on top. The lamb was super yummy... flavorful without being over salted or too spicy. (Actually it is refreshing to note that none of the tacos were over salted.) I seriously liked the pork - small chunk instead of ground with nice caramelized brown bits and slightly sweet finish. The cheese and sausage one had gooey melted cheese and a nice ground sausage. \n\nYou can tell these are assembled fresh on order.... a little slow? Maybe. But worth it. This isn't Taco*barf*Bell.\n\nPrice  (about 3 bucks per taco) versus quality is what gives this place 5 out of 5 for us... despite the (some-might-find-it-a-tad-slowish) inital service of the first round. We did appreciated the fact that they served the tacos in 2 courses instead of all at once. They were perfectly hot this way and not soggy in the least... so Rosa, our waitress, gets bonus points for that. She tried hard to please despite being a little rushed at times. \n\n We WADDLED home quite full... having consumed 4 tacos and 2 cokes  (love the bottled soft drinks... no soda fountains here) between 2 of us. Next time we will skip the second coke since we didn't finish both (and which is actually almost the price of a taco) and will consider having 3 tacos between us. Add the tip in it will be less than 20 bucks for 2 people. Not a bad price for something fresh tasty and filling.\n\nYep we will be back.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1},

It is not trying to be trendy... and yet by not being \"trendy\" Jardin Iwaki manages to be modern and clean in taste while respecting tradition. There is the occasional surprise as well. For example I don't think of bacon when i think japanese... but the small bite sized pancakes with bacon and dried fish.... oh my. I am in danger of drooling at the memory. \n\nDid I mention how pretty the servings are? \n\nVery decent sake menu... wine and Japanese beer are also available.... (not sapporo- for those wanting something different and very tasty). Their house sake is extremely decent for the price... and I recommend it hot... sooooo tasty.\n\nSeriously. .. why are you still reading this and not calling for a reservation?\n\nAs a side note... assuming you can handle the extra course you will need to reserve a day in  advance if you intend to have the EDO menu which does include a sushi course. Part of me regrets that we did not do this... but we intend to make up for it  ... by calling ahead to order and by skipping lunch so we have room.\n\n Also... it is a wonderfully tiny place... with extra space on a terrace... i would assume reservations would be a necessity on busy nights.\n\nAs for the service. .. expect polite, kind and gracious service. Also expect a relaxed pace while still efficient... it takes time to savour 6 or 7 courses.

Living on Roncy, I have been several times before (apparently I'm not a regular though--lol see below). The food has been good.  Not amazing, but good with good portions. Last Victoria Day Monday, I went with my family of 5 plus my mother for brunch. We did not have a reservation, and we were prepared to be shut out. But to our surprise, the host advised a wait of 15-20 minutes for a table for 6.  My wife and kids did some window shopping and I waited and chatted with my mom.  15 minutes turned to 25, but I assume that is par for the course and understand this is an estimate. We were asked a couple times by other servers about what we were waiting for. We were the only ones waiting and there were plenty of open tables of 2 and 4, but they did not offer to push 2 together, but again, I understand they want to keep their set up. After 30 minutes a woman, who appeared to be a manager or owner, came out and advised us that it would be another 30-40 minutes for a table of 6.  \n\nI was flabbergasted. I explained what we had been advised and that we had already been waiting 30 minutes. She apologized and said the person who had originally spoken to us made a mistake. She offered to put us in 2 back-to-back booths, but that wasn't going to work for us because we were there for a family brunch not just to eat. I suggested mildly that they could just push tables together (which would not have created any blockages). And her response to me (when no one else in 30 minutes had been waiting for a table), was that her \"regulars\" expect to be able to have those tables. What!!!!  I live in the area and had been there several times. What am I?  Chopped liver?  I was speechless at her unwillingness to address the \"mistake\" they had made and to try to seat us as soon as possible. It seemed like she just wanted us to leave. So we did. Wow.  \n\nI haven't really written a review like this before but I feel compelled. I was embarrassed in front of my family and I could not even relate to them the exchange in a way that seemed real.  Should I have made a scene?  It's just not my style. But I will certainly be relaying this tale to everyone in the 'hood.   \n\nWe ended up going to The Westerly, which I had not yet been to, two doors down. And I'm glad. We had great food (better than Sunrise) and infinitely better service. I highly recommend it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Me and my younger brother used to spend our allowance money on veal sandwiches, walking a couple blocks past Sicilian Ice cream, or other sweets vendors, as we valued the sandwiches more highly. Now, having seen more of the world and sampled its fare, I have a deep appreciation for the simplicity and quality of the sandwiches there. I don't know exactly why they taste better than any other Italian sandwiches but there is apparently some serious alchemy going on in the back with the fat ladies banging pots and hollering in Italian.  Those sandwiches are certainly for my money tastier and more satisfying than any gourmet panini with soft cheese and unpronounceable mushroom. \n\nThis locale retains a fair amount of its authenticity despite a half-hearted superfluous reno years ago. Nobody goes here for decor, service or ambiance, although the unapologetic lack of these is part of its charm. They come for sandwiches, and my mouth is filling up with saliva just thinking about it. No use describing it, just get one. \n\nAs a family man now living further west I don't get here often, and while the franchised facsimiles don't compare with the authenticity, I have to admit they seem to have a bit of it and the sandwiches are good. But the original is the original.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

She was very rude and at one point asked me a question and then didn't give me a chance to answer before holding her finger up at me (telling me to hold on) and picking up the phone to call up to the floor with the cars. When talking about filling the car up before bringing it back I was informed that the gas rate for them to fill the car back up was $2.17 and I said no we will fill it up. She informed me that I have to fill it up within 10 miles of the airport and have to bring a receipt and the receipt will show whether or not it was within 10 miles. I said that's fine we'll take care of it, $2.17 is expensive and she looked at me like I was an idiot so I asked her how much gas was in Charlotte and she stated that it was only a couple cents different which is a lie. Gas was $1.89 at 99% of the stations we saw except for the one right across the street from the airport. At this point I was so fed up with her that I just told her to add it on there. \n\nI was also asked if I wanted high, medium or low insurance? I was so pissed at this point that it didn't even register for me to say no insurance...although she probably would have somehow made me add it anyways. I also have a hold on my account for $50 more than the cost of the rental and my credit was run because I used a debit bank card instead of a credit card. She stated \"because you're using a debit card I will have to run your credit and your score will go down\". I did not have a credit card on me, which is why I used my bank card. Running my credit is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE, there is no reason for it.

I drove the car down here from the Portland, OR area, which meant that it got disgustingly dirty on the road trip down to Las Vegas. I am not a fan of automatic car washes, and I stumbled across Gloss It during my search of car detailers in the area. I gave Rich a call and he was incredibly friendly over the phone and said they could get me in within an hour and told me to come over. He was incredibly professional and friendly once I arrived, and took me through the shop and showed me around before his guys went to work on the car. He took the time to answer my questions regarding my own detailing techniques and was really informative regarding his products. Not only that, but he brought me the WiFi password to use while I waited for the car to get cleaned.\n\nThe car came out looking awesome, and both the employees who did the detail work did a great job and were very friendly. Rich, the owner, comes across as a passionate and friendly businessperson, and it really seems like he knows his trade.

Today me and my friends decided to go to Mabu Station because they have a wide selection of food and they were still open (compared to other cafes). I decided to order the mixed fruits with mango sauce topped on a scoop of ice cream, one of my friends ordered a waffle dessert. As me and my friends were casually talking, each of our dishes were being served, EXCEPT for one dish that literally took more than 20 minutes to be served. My friend and his girlfriend realized that their waffle was \"UNCOOKED\". In the picture, you can indicate the waffle does not display a golden brown colour which shows that it was not properly cooked and the texture of the bitten parts of the waffle looks like the waffle batter is sagging out. My friends decided to call out the waitress, her response through the problematic issue was \"sorry I can't fix this because you ate almost all of it\". In all case, a waitress should not be saying that if a waffle was uncooked especially if the toppings was hiding the uncooked waffle for customer not realising it was \"ACTUALLY UNCOOKED\". For my dessert, it was not appetising. Some fruits were fresh, but some of it killed my tastebuds. Seriously, why would they used canned preserved fruits to topped on my dish? I rather just go home and make the dessert by myself. \n\n\nWARNING FOR FIRST COMERS: Just because the restaurant\/interior or the pictures of the menu looks visual appealing, doesn't mean the food will satisfy your taste buds. \n\n\nI will not be coming to this restaurant again and I will definitely not recommend this restaurants to any dessert lovers.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Check in was quick and painless. However, was given keys to a room with two double beds. Was told that all reservations made through third parties are automatically given a room w\/ two doubles.....was ultimately given a room with a king bed. No big deal. Hotel was a virtually empty. \n\nHotel is old, old, old. The safety on the electrical outlet kept getting tripped by the ultra-high voltage device I always carry with me...my cell phone charger. Television set was ancient and terrible. Lock on the room door was broken. This might not make sense, but the room was very creaky. Bed was worn out. \n\nNow back to my comment regarding the hotel being virtually empty. The last night of our stay, a bus load of 10-13 year olds on a field trip were put in rooms on all sides of us. It was as if they literally put us in their block of rooms. There must have been forty of them with no more than one or two chaperons. They commenced to bang around and scream till the wee hours of the morning. Why is God's name did they have to put them all around us in an empty hotel? \n\nWith so many other great options in Scottsdale, certainly no reason to give this place another shot.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

We weren't greeted with a very warm welcome to start, and we were almost seated on the restaurant side but our table seemed a little close to the kitchen (open kitchen concept), so we opted to sit in the bar. The dated couches and decor in the bar seemed like it was due for a remodel, but we wanted to give the place a shot anyway. Our service was overall pretty lack luster, we had a few questions about the menu that either couldn't be answered or were answered quickly with a somewhat short response.. We opted to get the price fixe that included a cocktail, appetizer and dessert. The pastries they brought out were great, although the biscuits were a touch dry\/overcooked. Both my husband and I thought our food was mediocre for what we paying, and my steak with the crispy farm egg (egg was delicious and great!) was very overcooked.. Our bartender (didn't mention name) was busy chatting at the other end of the bar, so we sadly didn't order another bloody mary (which was also very good).\n\nOverall we just didn't feel as comfortable as we would've hoped for dining in a nicer establishment like Eleven..

Our bartender was fantastic, and not only had great knowledge of the menu, also gave us a good lesson on the difference between the types of tequila, because we didn't know about aged tequilas. Our margaritas were delicious, I had the spicy and it was just right on the spice. We ordered the guacamole after he said it's made fresh, and it was delicious! This might have been the best guacamole I've ever had. We ordered 2 tacos each, all were great.

Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, we'd definitely go to Szechwan Palace again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I went there for severe back pain. My first visit I was given medication, X-ray was done and had to get a MRI done. Three days after my first visit I went back in because the medication wasn't working.. When I was asked what was wrong I would begin to explain and would be interrupted every time. I was not given the chance to finish. The doctor gave me stronger meds and sent me on my way. After I went for my MRI I went back into get my results. The doctor explained to me that in the MRI there was nothing really serious and that I should be alright. When I was asked if I was ready to go back to work I informed the doctor that I was still feeling pain. This is when I felt the Jekyll and Hyde situation happened. He went from happy to pissed and 1.5 seconds. He began to yell at me telling me I didn't want to go back to work and he refused to fill out any FMLA papers that I needed to hand into work. He filled out a form for me to get blood work done and told me that my job was in jeopardy and walked out of the room. Oh I should add he also got in my face while talking with a loud voice. I really didn't want to go back there but I was unsure if another doctor would release me for work if they didn't treat me. I went back to get my blood results and to see if he was willing to release me for work. My blood work came back and it showed that I had inflammation I don't know about you but I pretty much think that indicates I'm in pain. The doctor did a 360 and was once again kind. This time he did fill out my FMLA papers and I left there with the intentions of never going back. I did end up going to another doctor that a friend had recommended and brought my MRI results with me. The new doctor also did x-rays and discovered there was a problem. I am now on my way to getting therapy and proper medication. I rarely write reviews good or bad however this time I felt the need to inform anyone who has intentions on going to this location. I know the others have really good reviews and I'm sure their encounter with the doctor went well. Mine did in the beginning too. If you want to go to a doctor who never gives you A chance to explain what is going on with you then by all means this is a doctor for you I wish you luck.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Wait staff seemed in a hurry to close. Couple shared a nice dish, and wife ordered salad. I ordered a large plate of traditional food to share. Couples food was good, salad nothing special, but mine was of poor quality. Heaping amount of food that had been cooked to long back and was not edible. Rather than send back and cause a scene I left with others. Examples was beef pieces cooked almost to charcoal, fried plantains hard as shoe leather, etc. I SHOULD have been told to order something else but it seems like the restaurant was willing to dump food on me that was probably recooked when I ordered. Likely won't go there again","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

This is a professional pharmacy as opposed to the chains who have Pharmacy as a sideline. I am a retired Pharmacist and will tell you that this is where you should get your prescriptions filled. Leave the grass seed and Easter candy to the chains, but depend on professional Pharmacist for your health needs.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},
