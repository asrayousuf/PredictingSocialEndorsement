Today was unique, I decided to dip my toes into this Caribbean spot since I've read the reviews. I got there after 8pm since I was starving and not in the mood to cook dinner so late, I decided to give this place my full attention. I noticed the details as far as the Jamaican music in the background, the dÃ©cor made me feel like as if I am somewhere lost in Jamaica by the sea. Only the sultry breeze and ocean were missing. There was only one lonely chicken patty left so I ordered it plus ordered the oxtail with white rice and cabbage with carrots. I ate the patty first and was blown away by the flavor,  I had to look around to make sure I wasn't somewhere in Brooklyn. I can only imagine if they have a Labor Day parade party in there, it would be a success because their food is already authentic and flavorful. This was my first visit there and not my last. I will make sure to stop by again maybe on Saturday to get some more patties. This patty had my eyes closed and toes curled and when that happens, to me that's a good sign. Not at all disappointed and the employees there were very approachable and nice. I had my food to go and splurge at home, I ate my patty before exiting Ocean Blue and got so excited, wish they had more patties. Again, I was blown away.

Once I spread the cream cheese on the toasted bread, I was hooked.

Now, when it comes to patties, I go for texture and taste of the meat. First I had the chicken which had spice but the crust of the patty to me wasn't all that great, a bit soggy which I think they put them in the microwave, to me that's a no-no with Jamaican patties. Patties to me are supposed to be flaky and the meat should have good spices. Both patties were ok, not all that thrilling.

Because of the little dog, I told him that Rocky was a service dog and that I would talk to them after my daughter woke up, he reply again rudely and loudly, that there was nothing he could do and again demanding us to evacuate immediately. Anyhow, to make a long story short, this place was full of drunk people witch I guess in kind of normal for a casino business, also full of pat smoking individuals, etc...... I just can't believe that they kicked us out like we were some kind of criminals, because of a 5 pounds SERVICE dog, and they can't even wait for my little one to wake up, this is 100% outrageous. As I previously said Stay away from Circus Circus.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

To my surprise the service manager volunteered the same guess.  He thought a seal maybe hadn't gotten seated properly and asked me to leave the car with them so they could drop the tank again and check it out.

I would consider myself a ramen connoisseur of sorts. I tend to seek out new ramen spots frequently. I've been spoiled with the likes of Shin-sen-gumi and Santouka so I have standards set pretty high.\n\nPer my fellow Yelpers positive reviews for Ramen Sora I visited to taste their ramen.\n\nExperience as follows:\n\n-Ambience: great spot, friendly staff. Nothing in particular stands out, typical privately owned Japanese ramen shop. We went around 2 for a late lunch, place was not full.\n\n-Service: service was prompt and mostly friendly. I wouldn't say they went out of their way to give us great service, but I have no complaints on quality or speed of service.\n\n-Food: we ordered the pork fried rice, shoyu ramen, and the shio ramen. We aren't particular for toppings so we usually go plain (bf) or with negi and egg (me).\n\n*pork fried rice: it tasted great. Perfectly seasoned, great balance of pork and flavor. Rare is the day when we get a delectable side more appetizing than the main course. \n\n*shio ramen: broth was weak and had an undesirable aftertase. Noodles were nothing special and the seasoned egg was flavorless. I was very disappointed in the broth.\n\n*shoyu ramen: this was my bf's meal. His words: \"it's plain\". I believe one thing that makes ramen delicious is its ability to give you complex flavors. When a broth is nothing more than dashi stock and soy sauce, you've got a problem.\n\nOverall\/last remarks: while the ramen wasn't particularly good or special, I don't think this is a bad spot. Anyone who likes to have a variety of broths\/styles would come here. But for me, I'm very particular about a ramen spot to take pride in their ramen. Generally that's done when a spot takes care to perfect a particular broth or soup. When they stretch themselves too thin their ramen tends to suffer. I would recommend this place to newbies or anyone looking for a decent lunch spot.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I ate there a year ago and was impressed, but we were with a group and with conversation, didn't pay attention to the details.  \n\nFor meal, we showed up a little bit early and one of the hostesses informed us that they were getting a table ready and walked us the the bar to a couch to wait.  The bar staff was attentive even though we just ordered water... we had a drink at the Eiffel Tower bar before arriving.  A young hostess found us in the bar area and walked us to our table upstairs that was not what I was imagining for my perfect birthday dinner.  It was a small, two-top table at the exit for the staff area directly outside of the elevator. Our waiter took our wine order and the support staff was very attentive, but it wasn't the kind of table we expected for a fine dining experience.\n\nBefore our sommelier arrived with our wine, the nice young hostess came by to ask us how we liked our accommodations. I told her my concerns about the table and she said she would see what she could do.  We expected a move to a similarly tiny table in a better location.  However, the slender teenaged girl who, despite her age, was a consummate professional, informed us that we were being asked to accompany her to the chef's table.  We were walked back downstairs with the sommelier in tow to a fantastic booth that faced the kitchen and was directly in front of the executive chef's work area (if you were wondering... he doesn't slow all night and catches every detail.\n\nOur waiter, Chris, was a fantastic waiter.  He was detail oriented yet personal enough to connect while remaining a professional disconnect large enough to make sure that the dining experience was about me and my wife having  wonderful meal together.  He was there when we wanted him to be and was at the edges of the room at all other times in case he was needed.\n\nThe staff was unflappable in all situations and handled themselves professionally.  Assisting Chris was a wait staff assistant that missed nothing.  If water got 1\" low, he was there to refill it.  If my wife slipped off to powder her nose and her napkin was neatly folded 20 seconds after her departure.\n\nNow the food.  My wife ordered the rib cap and a lobster tail.  I ordered the 22 oz bone in ribeye medium-rare with an accompaniment of king crab legs.  We added the mushrooms and creamed spinach.  The steaks were absolutely perfect.  My ribeye was so good I told Chris that it made me want to \"smack my mamma.\"  I'm not sure he's accustomed to that.  I don't like creamed spinach, but I ate all of it.  It was like spinach crack. \n\nTo sum it up, our entire experience here was fantastic and made us feel like we were welcomed and the staff genuinely wanted to please us. I would return every week if it isn't 2000 miles away.\/\/","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My wife had the fish and chips which was fantastic.  The fish was thick filets and perfectly cooked.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I'm hooked.  I'm no shepherd's pie expert, but it was a fantastic dish.\n\nWe went back the next night just for a drink.  We didn't expect more than the ambience that we experienced during the FIFA match and we were wrong.  Ri Ra, what I gathered was band that plays there regularly, was playing and they were quite good.

We recently moved to town and needed a pediatrician for our daughter.  For her first appointment, we waited a long time (in the small waiting room and there are no toys at all for kids, which seems odd since seeing children is such a large part of their practice).  We went just for a regular check up but I really can't imagine sitting there waiting that long with a sick child.  By the time we saw the doctor it was almost two hours after the actual appointment time and by reading the other reviews, it's not a rare occurance.  Dr. George was pleasant and seemed knowledgable and also made a good reference to a speacialist our daughter needed so that was a plus.  Dr. mentioned he's always available by email which I thought was great because our prior Dr didn't give us that option.  I left that appointment feeling neutral and was willing to still come back and give the office more opportunities to prove this was a great place.  Then about a week after the appointment, I emailed the dr some pictures of my daughter because I was concered about a rash she had developed. No response.  So after several days of using ointment, fortunately it got better and I didn't need to bring her in.  Then she got sick and was vomiting a lot in the middle of the night.  I called the dr's office and left a message with all of my information and that I was concerned and needed them to telll me what I should do. NO RESPONSE *EVER*.  This was weeks ago.  I really miss my old pediatrician in California where there was always a Dr. on call and someone would call back within 15 minutes no matter what time at night.  Seriously, how could they have an email and voicemail option and not return messages..  isn't this a potential liability??  I'm not going to stay around to find out at my children's expense so I'm going to have to find another office that really has time to be more patient focused.  Maybe this one is too busy and I would not recommend this office to anyone I care about.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My goal was to get him comfortable in the water and have fun with other kids around.  What I realize is that's it's all about the instructor and they can be so different from each other.  Very early on (but after we had one terrible one who was apathetic, let my son sink under water several times while panicking cause he couldn't get up breath causing my son to be scared even for the following two lessons with other instructors) I talked to the front desk to get their feedback on what they've heard from parent reviews and I was able to narrow it down to the best instructor for my son. She's kid friendly and teaches good technique.  \nThe place could be managed better because it seems they really should invest some money to fix some things that are started to look a bit run down. Locker rooms are not so nice.  It's like there lots of college kids working for the summer here but I don't really notice anyone really running the place.\nOverall it's a fun place for kids to go swimming indoors in warm water but if I wanted my son to really get serious about becoming a strong swimmer, I would look elsewhere.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

It was a clusterfk of emotions...all out of whack, and all undetermined.\n\nThe evening started out good and bad. When we arrived, the parking lot was full, so the valet person told us to go away (WTF?) the valet line was backed up so bad and they were so unprofessional and rude about it; we literally decided to drive onto the separating garden island thing to get out (we keeps it classy lol). We didn't notice the cops on the street watching us from maybe a stone's throw away. They watched us ride first class on that struggle bus as we broke every traffic law in the book. They paused momentarily then LAUGHED (dafuq?!). We finally parked in the next plaza down at the farmer's market.\n\nWe were a group of 14, so naturally they sent us upstairs to one of the private rooms (had a door and errtang). THOSE STAIRS NEED RENOVATING DOE. NARROW ASS CASA LOMA ASS LOOKIN (if you've ever done that journey to the top) 1905-SECRET-STEPS RESEMBLIN STEPS. NO! Tight short skirts\/ dresses, heels, and narrow  steps DO NOT GO TOGETHER. You have to walk by the ENTIRE DINING ROOM to get to the stairs btw. Great architectural planning, Octagon (smh). Anyways, upon entering the otherwise perfectly beautiful establishment, you are immediately welcomed by the owner (methinks). He's possibly the ONLY competent customer service provider on the entire team. A nice small bald man. He takes your jacket off (and on) for you (complimentary coat check). The first thing I noticed after the gorgeous deep mahogany wooden walls, fireplace, framed art, stained glass windows, antique decor, dim lights, and classy ambiance, was the service. We had about 3 waiters assigned to us, and they were absolutely professional...AT FIRST. Lookin' all busy n' shit. They be wipin' down their foreheads, huffin n' puffin all up in my personal bubble in attempt to silently enunciate their strong desire for a generous tip I assume (made me uncomfortable). You're pouring a glass of water, calm yourself. Mind you these waiters are relatively older men, ones who look like they done had their midlife crisis back in the  80's.\n\nFood came, no confusion with orders. Everything cooked to everyone's desired rareness\/ tenderness. Maybe a little under-seasoned, but that's okay, it was still good. The food chapter of this evening was smooth sailing and we experienced no problems. JOKES! You know bout that pms doe, it'll seem all proper and shit until it rears its ugly ass head to bite you in the tuchus! The calm before the storm. Ya feel? So, everyone was I guess just about finished eating. EXCEPT, WE WEREN'T. HOW ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AWAY MY MEAL BEFORE I FINISH IT?! HOW ARE YOU STILL EMPLOYED TAKING AWAY A PLATE FULL OF FOOD! BRO. FACEPALM! I actually have no words for you, actually that's a lie, this review is longer than any essay I've written in my university life. And then you have the temerity to say it was an empty plate. I KID YOU NOT, the mans tried to argue with me that there was nothing on the plate. And then he proceeded to tell me that it's on the kitchen table, he will bring it back, that it hasn't been thrown out yet. Are you ready for this next bit? (As if that last statement wasn't messed up enough on its own, bout \"on the kitchen table, bring it back\"). THIS GUY BRINGS BACK SOME NEXXX PERSON'S HALF EATEN MEAL. #DEAD. Yelp, I can't even make this shit up if I tried. I was so flabbergasted and shocked, I didn't know how to respond to that. So, I kind of just stood there in silence for a moment with bewilderment in eyes, I straight up looked anencephalic. MY GAWD. Oh yeah, and then they asked us to pay for the meal we never ate (These guys lol). The manager got involved, after 15 infuriating minutes of arguing, they offered a free dessert, I didn't want dessert, so it was finally voided. But in a restaurant as \"reputable\" as The Octagon, who markets themselves a certain way and ensures a \"fine-dining\" experience, I feel like it should've been handled much more professionally, and the problem should've never arisen to begin with. The offer to void the meal should've come from their end without a debate. What kind of business argues with their patrons and shames them?! \n\nFinally, PAYMENT TIME. Ohhh muhfkn boy! You ready fuhdis? Our bill was $800?-ish. Which is more than reasonable. (BTW, YOU CAN'T SPLIT BILLS HERE, come prepared with cash). We were never made aware of this over the phone, or before eating even (Thanks again!). So our waiter now starts giving us mad attitude. He made it be known he was irritated with us (who fkd up doe? Don't be displacing your anger onto me, I'm the one with an empty stomach). So, I put the bill on my visa, and WOAH, THIS GUY ACTUALLY THREW MY CARD BACK AT ME. LIKE PHYSICALLY THREW MY CARD AT  ME.

Most, or rather ALLL almond croissant in the city taste relatively the same if they're good, be it nadege, Jules, la cigogne...etc, if they're praise worthy, they generally don't  have too much distinction between them. Brioche doree broke that stereotype and knocked it out of the park. They just put up a new set of rules and changed the almond croissant game. Not only was I turned off by the esthetic appeal of their pastries, but also their RIDICULOUS PRICES!! NO WHERE in Toronto have I seen an almond croissant so expensive!! But now I somewhat wearily say, rightfully so! \nTheir almond croissant is not soft and filled with paste like most others, it's the right amount of sweet and the consistency is a little more coarse, it's CHEWY, if you will. Might I dare say: if caramel or toffee were in bread form, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE!!!!!!! Yum! I devoured the  croissant with frightening ease on a full stomach.

If you don't, I don't know which rock you live under, but I can beyond a shadow of a doubt guarantee you, neither does anybody else. \nIt's possibly the ONLY\/ LARGEST grocery\/supermarket in Toronto (H marts and tiny hole in the wall stores don't count). Anyways, now that we've clarified what Galleria is, meet Bakery Gateau; the bakery INSIDE the grocery store. \nYou know how Western groceries have a deli section, an artisan section, a cake and pastry section, and then grocery isles? Well ethnic grocery stores tend to have the same thing, be it an Italian, Persian, Greek supermarket, they differ scarcely, I mean really how differently can you establish your grocery store from one to the next? \nExcept ASIAN supermarkets. MOST, if not all Asian supermarkets I've noticed have their grocery stores...and then, outside the checkout isles, they have EXTRA STORES; similar to that of a Walmart (Ah, nowww you get it. lol). Usually, these stores are specialty stores, esp. ones that carry products from the country native to that grocery store that you wouldn't otherwise be able to find. So, they'll have pharmacies, holistic medicine stores, mattress\/ bed sheet store (Asians are particular about what they sleep on and in, it's odd :S), beauty supply store, so on and so forth. This includes BAKERIES sometimes. The Galleria chain of supermarkets have this bakery called Bakery Gateau. \nThey produce pastries, desserts, and breads of great quality. (Asians don't really have bread loafs as do the Europeans, they have snacking bakes that are supposed to be able to play the efficient role of both a snack and a meal interchangeably, depending on the nature of your situation and appetite). So their breads are stuffed, filled, and\/or topped with a myriad of ingredients, an amalgamation of flavours and nutrients (not always healthy, just delicious). Always fresh baked and PREPACKAGED for you to pick and choose, grab and check out (once again on that Asian efficiency bandwagon). Unlike western bakeries where you look through a damn glass display case and have to ask a million questions about what something is and then struggle communicating with the clerk trying to tell him\/her what it is you want by pointing at it (\"no, not that one, the one next to it, no no the other side, yeah, that.\"). The only thing in glass display cases are CAKES, full sized cakes. \nAnyways, go to this bakery and indulge in a little bit of culture. It's well worth the experience. (ESP the self-serve glass case breads).\nEven the coffee is self-serve (I don't think they're of the greatest quality though, I mean....Asia doesn't particularly specialize in espresso beans, they're no experts of coffee brews, maybe just latte art)\np.s. they have more than just what you can grab, they have iced desserts you have to order at the counter.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I lived in Madison for a few years before moving up north and the Old Fashioned was one of my absolutely favorite places. So when Bob and I returned to Madison after years of being away, it was the one place that I absolutely had to return to. This is the place, after all, that gave me my favorite drink - the Old Fashioned. We arrived on a Saturday and the place was PACKED! Not unusual, we were prepared. We put our names down and they have a neat new system where they text you when your table is almost ready. So you are able to leave and grab a drink somewhere else (I would strongly recommend Merchant) while you are waiting. We waited for about 45 minutes and were quickly seated near the window in the main front room. Our server was fast and friendly and brought us our drinks lickety split. I (of course) had the Old Fashioned and it was just as good as I remembered - but different than I drink them now. They use Korbel Brandy and Sprite, I am used to having Bookers and water. They are sweeter than what I am used to - but still really good. We had the cheese curds, which are far and away the best cheese curds in the Midwest... maybe tied with the ones at the MN State Fair. There is less breading and more cheese than other places and they are SO good. Bob got the slow roasted pork shoulder and I got the house burger. They were both SO SO SOOOOO good! The burger was a sloppy, messy, drippy concoction of deliciousness and the sandwich was the perfect balance of spicy, sour and sweet. The food has an \"upscale down home\" quality to it. It's not super traditional fare, there are some surprises with the food but it's still familiar enough that it's really approachable. Everything about the place felt familiar and awesome! My only (TINY) complaint is that the tables near the host stand are subject to the door opening and closing, so during the winter it can get a little chilly there. If you are in Madison and really want to experience some exceptional Wisconsin food, then you NEED to come here. As Nick Offerman said, \"It's the only place where you can get a Bratwurst in the form of a burger, and to me -- there is no finer comestible than a deep-fried cheese curd.\" And who can argue with Ron Swanson?","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

We came here before we had a night out on the town and I ordered a very simple Cobb salad and Bob ordered a french dip. Okay, I know that there are different interpretations of Cobb salads, but I do believe that they all contain more than lettuce. My salad was a bowl of warm romaine with 1 piece of chicken that cost $24. What the heck people!? Bob's french dip was oily with tough meat and no taste. Don't worry though, it only cost $28. This was one of the worst meals that I can remember eating in quite some time. Probably to rival Moe's clam chowder in Portland. Maybe they think that you'll be so drunk that you don't notice? Well, I did. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else, literally ANYWHERE else and you will get better food than here. The only reason I am not giving this 1 star (or 0 stars) is that the drinks were good. Definitely not worth the price - but boozy and tasty. Good grief!

Madison has a cocktail lounge that puts the Marvel Bar to shame... or at least seriously green with envy. We arrived on a Saturday night around 6:00pm and the place was packed! We did not realize that it was restaurant week in Madison so a lot of the tables were reserved for people that were going to be taking advantage of that wonderful event. We were just there for the booze, plain and simple. The ambiance is very cool. Industrial chic - lots of concrete, glass, reclaimed wood and Edison bulbs. Lighting is dim, giving it a an intimate feel. If it was not SO crazy busy, it would be a really cool place to go on a date. I would say that they could benefit from some sound dampening. Maybe a rug or textile somewhere, because it can get awfully loud in there! I asked our mixologist for a whiskey sour (note - they're not bartenders. These people work magic with cocktail shakers and unique ingredients, they almost look like mad scientists or apothecaries with the amount of tiny glass bottles they work with) and it was absolutely the BEST whiskey sour I have ever had. It was done traditionally with the egg white foam - but I loved that there was a bit of orange essence and (I swear I could taste it) nutmeg or cinnamon? The prices are what you would expect at a higher end cocktail lounge - but given the quality, I would say you are getting away with a deal.

If the answer is - not at all, do NOT eat here. While in Vegas I wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said Hash House A Go Go. Given that he was about 6'5\" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. My girlfriends and I arrived around 11:00am on Sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. That wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. We were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. Like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn?

The portion that I received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and I am not a light eater. It probably weighed 20 pounds. It has fried chicken, mashed potatoes, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. Despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. Truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. The service was fast and the coffee was great! Really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large. There is no reason anyone should need to eat that much food (now if you want to eat it, that's another story). But if you're looking to lay around for the remainder of the day in a food coma while wearing stretchy pants - then make sure you eat at Hash House!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I ordered beef and broccoli my girlfriend got orange chicken both were fresh the broccoli was not soggy or over cooked like most places the orange chicken had great flavor and moist less batter and more chicken how it should be.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
