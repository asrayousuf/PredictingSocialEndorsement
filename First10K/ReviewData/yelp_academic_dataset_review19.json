It's been open since I think around 2003, maybe 2004. I've never had bad food from here. It is a chain, so the food is what you'd expect from a Chick-fil-a. It deffinitely costs more than a chicken sandwich from McDonald's, but I find the spicy chicken sandwiches from Chick-fil-a to be the best fast food sandwich you can get. Just make sure to pick your sauce separately. I had a friend who always complained about them being dry because he didn't know they don't put sauce on there, you get it on the side. After he knew that, he started eating there regularly.\n\nIt is fast food though, so don't expect a life changing experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My plate was messy, as soon as he put it down everything started falling off onto the table. \n\nMy mother was not even a bite into her sandwich when it all started falling apart. The bread seemed to be old and dried out, it kept crumbling up and everything fell out. She stopped eating after that, and when she asked to get it taken off the bill since she barely had anything to eat, our server gave off that negative vibe again. \n\nFinally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22.

Granted, it was 4th of July weekend, but you would think they'd have adequate parking for the amount of people they'd anticipate for the holidays. \n  Second, the room they gave me was already taken even though they allegedly checked to see it was free. Apparently, there was a mix up and the room they were supposed to give me was not ready yet. How is that possible? I arrived at 4:30 pm when check in was at 3:00 pm.

Why were the doors closing on me even as I was stepping in the middle of them! Where are the fucking motion sensors!To top it all off, those horrendous doors closed on my elderly grandmother and it made her fall on her face. Did the doors open up? NO!

They provided good service for a number of purchases my family made, but it seems things have changed recently. After receiving a ring for Christmas I took it in to be resized and was warned by the lady that I should keep a little extra room as your fingers may measure small in the winter. I had to pay to have the ring resized even when though it was a gift from their store, which seems like a service they should offer along with the purchase. When I got it back it did still seem too large and could spin around my finger, but they gave the same guidance. I waited a few months for the weather to warm up and the ring is still too large. When I returned to the store, they wanted to charge me another resizing fee to 'fix' it, even though it was upon their guidance that I accepted the 'roomier' fit in the first place. I'm really disappointed in their service and the general manner in which they now seem to be doing business. They've lost me and my family as clientelle.","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":0},

She is attentive to fine details, as a professional colourist she is considerate of the demands of my hair type and knows the tools and science behind processing without tremendous damage. Her technique leaves my hair looking natural and polished, I am always pleased with the outcome. \nSince she's been working on my colour I have received a lot attention and compliments on the colour tone and balayage style, and recommend anyone looking for an experienced colour technician to visit her.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

This was the second time I came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. \n\n First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.\n I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was \"prepared,\" there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.\n\nTo make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear, this place was so profit driven that the VET DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY DOG FOR FLEAS BEFORE GIVING ME A PRESCRIPTION ON MY FLEA MEDICATION. The mere mention of \"I think my dog might have fleas but I don't know how to check for them\" initiated a conditioned response \"I'll prescribe flea medication\" WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DOG. I asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. She then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!\nAs I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. \n\nAround 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a \"real emergency.\" I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.\n After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet \"cone of shame\" that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying \"ow\" when my dog nibbled at her fingers.\nI excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.\nI think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":0},

In addition to having a super memorable and cute logo, they have a lot of space for large events and a minimalist venue making it a versatile brewery for holding events. Today for the Panther's tailgate, they had Tin kitchen's food truck in the back for hungry folk to annihilate. I'm new to the idea of bars without food offerings inside but I find this model genius; Sycamore itself doesn't have a kitchen, instead has partnerships with local food trucks so that the menu changes every time you come. What is special about them is that they do have a wide array of special brews to choose from, so for the adventurous beer drinker, this is the perfect place for people who get bored of beer that taste just like beer. They have special brunch beer cocktails which seem to change weekly. I haven't tried them personally but they look and sound pretty interesting! Bloody Mary beer cocktail anyone?\n\n In particular for fall, I enjoyed their Cinnabun Brown Ale, Sweet Potato Wheat, Pumpkin Latte Blonde, and Gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber. A pint of gourd Have Mercy Pumpkin Amber on a Sunday ran me $6, -not bad. While we watched the Panthers game inside, live music was running outside which was enjoyable once the game ended. I can imagine it being packed for weekly tailgates on days with home games, but when it is not busy, it is a very nice brewery to just sit and relax in. I haven't been here after work yet, but I always see it lit up and populated on the ride home from the light rail. We didn't see any typical backyard games like horseshoe, corn hole or giant Jenga, so I think it's a good place to go for a chill night of hanging out. But when there are special promotions or events going on, you can count on me that I'll be back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

There was a line out the door on a Wednesday evening. It was cozy, almost like having a large house party. The beer on tap is the greatest since sliced bread. Allow your customers to serve themselves, and you'll surpass records of beer sold during your first weekend of operations. You can try and be loyal to one beer, but It's quite inexpensive to get a sampling of each (and there are dozens of beers on the wall) - beers range from 30cents an ounce to a few dollars. The wristband is convenient, just scan your band on the little hop engraving under each tap, and it will activate. Angle your glass before you press the nozzle (this is how you avoid a glass full of foam) and pour away. This place is cozy in the winter but would also be great during the summer as well. Bring a date, or bring a crowd and have a pizza party here- it's a place you have to check out if you're in the area. Restaurants around Hoppin are also pretty good so if you don't eat here, you can always hop across the street to Seoul kitchen.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

You think there are only three tables but you look to your left and there's a whole other seating space to take advantage of. I came here right before the said happy hour and got a medium cappuccino sprinkled with hot chocolate powder for $3.75 (with tax). I saw that they also offered breakfast items that are similar to Bluestone Lane in NYC, like the avocado smash bagels and avocado eggs Benedict.  The drinks are all under $4, but the price of the menu items seem to make up for the difference. A fruit cup will set you back $5.

Yes, they are famous for their sushi lunch buffet, but I have never been there for that! I declare that as the next frontier to conquer...\n\nI had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.\n\n For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.\n\n I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend. Either way, I can't wait to go back for the buffet, but since my office is just out of range from here, I guess I'll have to wait for a holiday.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1},

I've visited their shop at least 10 times over the last 7 months.  Their peanut butter - chocolate ice cream is probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Truthfully I would visit more often but their service is awful.  Allow me to explain -\n\nEVERY SINGLE TIME I visit they are out of something.  If I want to order a banana split they are out of bananas.  If I order a sundae that comes with strawberries, they are out of strawberries.  They always have the same excuse, Oh my manager just went to the store to get some more (insert missing item), is it okay without?  One time I was told, we are out of bananas, I suggested a discount for a banana split without bananas and suddenly out of nowhere, a banana was found.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is, I never see the same ice cream makers in the store, always a new fresh face.  As a result, what I order is NEVER consistent.  One visit I will get a generous serving of whipped cream, the next visit hardly any.  Next visit I will get an entire sliced banana, the next 6 thin slices.  Obviously there are issues with the management and ownership of this cute and yummy little ice cream shop as this can all be traced back to them.    I wish they would get their act together and provide consistent customer service instead of excuses.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.\n\nThe customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners\/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit\/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail\/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.\n\nSkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.

I first discovered them when I walked by and saw all of their veils in the front window. I popped in without an appointment and they were very welcoming and accommodating. After I showed them a photo of my dress and told them about my wedding and what I was looking for, the consultant said she had the perfect veil for me. It was gorgeous! Simple and elegant, but very dramatic. Their prices were also incredibly reasonable. I wasn't able to make a decision at that time, but they created a file for me and kept the veil on record. When it came time for my mom to look for her dress I recalled how many absolutely gorgeous mother of the bride and bridesmaid dresses I walked by on my way to look the veils. After going to several bridal stores in Vancouver, I suggested that my mom take a look at Ave 22. She had a really good idea of what she wanted, but couldn't find it anywhere and was having a hard time describing it to her consultants. We met with Cara at Ave 22. She was an excellent listener and has the patience of a saint! We went through a lot of dresses, and Cara was always kind and caring, and helped us with eliminating what wasn't working. Their assortment was so wonderful that we ended up finding two amazing dresses for my mom. She couldn't decide between the two, but their prices were so excellent that she ended up buying both. I also came back to try on the veil I had originally looked at. When I saw it on with my dress it was absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for. I had previously gone to Kleinfeld for look at veils and accessories, and found that I liked Ave 22's selection far more than Kleinfeld's. Thank you to Shirley, the owner, and Cara for such  wonderful and stress free experiences. I would highly recommend them to all of my girlfriends. My only regret is not finding them before I bought my wedding dress.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Then sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for my food. 45 minutes later I receive my food, and they are missing 1 item... so I wait some more. At last, my order is ready! Then I go to pay after I get my food (which is the strangest thing) they would of let me walk out if I hadn't mentioned I never paid yet. Great food, great people, but they need a lot more help in the back. 1 person to cook and 1 person to take orders obviously isn't cutting it. The people ahead of me actually walked out without getting their food. I mean a 45 minute wait when I was the 3rd person in line for a baked potato seems a little strange to me.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The only reason for 4 stars is that my boyfriend mentioned he had a bit of a mix up while dealing with Shane Co. \n\nWe went in together to pick out the ring and at that time he put a deposit down to hold the diamond that we were looking at (I was not aware of this as he went back at a later time). At that point it was explained to him that the ring would be ready in about a month. Well he said a month went by and still no word from Shane Co. He decided to call them to get a status on the ring. He spoke with them and they said they hadn't even started making it yet and that he needs to pay in full before the make the ring. He immediately is a little irritated as a whole month was wasted and he put a deposit down. I would assume he would of gotten some communication or follow up in regards to the deposit and when he would like the ring. My fiance paid in full for the remaining balance and at this point we are another month out before he gets the ring.\n\n I'm not sure if it was misunderstanding or if my fiance was told wrong information. Either way, it was not an ideal situation to be in.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over. No manager came to apologize to the lady right away and all the did was give her a free appetizer! Terrible customer service, the manager addressed the lady as \"the one who got drinks spilled on\". How about you learn some manners, sir! \n\nAnyways, after 50 minutes of sitting there we finally see our server again to take our order. The food came and what do you... it's super crappy tasting! I'll take my $50 for 2 people and go else where... like the Bell Rd location. This place sucks, so bad.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},
