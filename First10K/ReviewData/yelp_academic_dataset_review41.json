But what they do sell is fantastic. I had the sashimi bento box. All the nigiri was stellar, very fresh and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly: The shrimp was tender and not at all rubbery, and the tempura coating was delicate. For dessert, they gave us a couple complimentary bites of honeydew melon. Prices were very reasonable and service was prompt and friendly. Some Japanese ladies were eating at the table next to us -- not a perfect sign of quality and authenticity, but a good one nonetheless. Highly recommended overall.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

But my experience with Boojum Tree since day one has been just that. I find it hard to believe anyone that visits this venue will be able to walk away from it without finding it beyond gorgeous. We visited several venues (including ones that priced themselves much higher) and Boojum Tree is clearly the cream of the crop. However, the best part of Boojum Tree was my interaction with Jennifer. You don't realize when you're starting this that you're not only selecting a venue, but you're also going to have a lot of interaction with the venue's coordinator or in this case GM. My wife describes her as thebomb.com and I simply appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed every conversation wit her. She was timely, respectful, friendly, sharp, hilarious and just a blast to be around.  I will sincerely miss communicating with her all the time but I still intend to bug her just because she is so wonderful. She gave me the best set of vendors to work with and the whole wedding went off like a well-oil machine. We were able to customize so much to make it our own but it wouldn't have been possible to achieve that level of perfection anywhere else. Boojum Tree will forever hold such a special place in my heart. If I ever find myself driving by the area during an open house on Tuesday night, I'm just going to pretend I'm getting married all over again to experience it's atmosphere.

The quality of their fish, menu variety, and prices are unbeatable!  My bf brought me here after reading some yelp reviews but I was extremely skeptical.  After moving from LA about 3 years ago, I have not been able to find a good sushi spot in Phoenix.  Ive tried so many places guided by yelp, but was always disappointed.  Luckily, we stumbled upon this gem!  Everyone was so friendly and the service was amazing! I work in the restaurant industry, so I am definitely a critic when it comes to good service.  The owner, Juno, was so personable and genuine, he really made our night special  The staff was accommodating and knowledgeable about the food.  This was certainly the cherry on our evening.  They use purple sushi rice for their rolls and nigiri, which is much healthier than plain white sushi rice.  I was a little hesitant when I saw the purple rice, but it was delicious!!!

At 4pm a worker was using a floor machine to wash the floor in the aquarium and I felt I was in the way. Way to much construction. Nothing but over grown landscaping where the bears used to be. Way too much of nothing in between exhibits. By the kids area by the sea lions there is a picnic area and there was one table with shade and a zoo worker was sitting in that seat on her head phones. The new dining area is nice but we sure pay for it if you eat there. Escalators are broke all the time. Literally never running so to enter you have to use one of two slow moving elevators that make the worst noises and there is constantly a line. Bathrooms are not maintained. Totally went down hill. I bought season passes last year and won't do that again. Wont be back and will drive to living treasures or any other zoo like Erie or Toledo or Cincinnati.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

It is also ridiculously expensive.  But if you get past the high-roller, Sin City riff, you'll find outrageously good food and drink and attentive service -- the kind of impeccable that you can't find fault with, although you can't really be sure it's enough to bring you back.  \n\nI was in Vegas on business, and wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner.  I was warmly greeted and not made to feel awkward as a solo diner.  The wait staff was very pleasant and attentive, from the hostess, to the waiter, to the flirty sommelier.  I had an excellent seared ahi appetizer, although I confess this was a second choice because the ala cart pricing scheme for more typical Italian choices was just simply outrageous: build-you-own platters of olives, cheeses, meats and pickled veggies at $12 PER ITEM!  So a antipasti platter of 6-to-8 items, which might run you $14 to $18 anywhere else, you're looking at close to a hundred bucks here.  Just stupid.  I had a stuffed veal chop that was excellent, actually worth the $49 ala carte price.  The wine list rocks.  I enjoyed an unbelievably good Super Tuscan from my favorite Italian winery, Gaia, a treat that I rarely see on wine lists outside of Europe or China.\n\nNot a place I'd take the family, but a solid choice for a romantic dinner or to impress a client.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The way the entire transaction was handled makes me not want to buy a Honda ever again. Apologies for taking so long to write the review.\n\nHere's how the story unfolded:\nSaturday, 10\/22:\nVisited the dealership, met with Corey (Internet Sales Manager), we drove to the adjacent lot to verify the Honda Odyssey I was specifically looking for was on the lot. We confirmed the car was on the lot. I told Corey ill be back the next day if I'm ready to the deal for the car. He said the car has an additional \"$1100 of options\", but we'll see what we can do.\nAt this point, I had seen the msrp sticker ($44,250) and the dealer added options attached to the vehicle specified for the deal.  Dealer Add ons included:\no Cantek Protection   $399\no Window Tint   $299\no Protection Package  $449\no Alarm (Remote Start) $895\no Appearance Package $195\nTOTAL    $2237\n\nSunday 10\/23, Returned Sunday around noon, greeted by Shane, the only person that I would care to work with again, told him I was ready to do a deal if they could beat the $41,500 quoted by Concord, for the specific car.  \n3. Corey came back with the counteroffer to match $41,500. \n4. I agreed and we proceeded to finalize the deal. To prevent any misunderstanding, I reconfirmed the dealer options that I expected with the car. At that point, Corey mentioned that the Cantek Protection, Window Tint, Protection Package were NOT included.  This was a surprise to me, but Corey seeming to think it was ok. For the $1146 in options, he reduced my payment by $4.50 a month. That left only the alarm and appearance package to come with the car.\n5. Corey verbally mentioned that the document fee was $395. As we reviewed the prelim contract, the document fee specified in the contract was $295. Rather than honor the written amount, he crossed it off and changed the fee. This was the next example of subpar customer service. 99% of dealerships would acknowledge the mistake and give the customer the benefit. Not in this case. \n6. Once the prelim paper work was complete, we headed to the finance office\na. Firstly, we went through the details of the add ons. The first accessory was Cantek Protection, I said it was actually not included. The finance rep, said it WAS included.  I can't believe the miscommunication between the front and back end. Then came the discussion about the alarm.  The finance manager said the alarm was NOT included. I couldn't believe it. The one item that was making the deal marginally beneficial was excluded? I said no way, call Corey....Corey came back to the office and said that it was not included, and I misunderstood. Since the deal was put together differently, this was overlooked. Ridiculous. At this point, I had invested 5 hours of my vacation to finalize the deal, and i wasn't going to leave empty handed, in hindsight maybe I should have. So I conceded on the alarm, making the deal at Concord Honda in Northern California a better overall deal. \nb. After all the back and forth with Corey about the monthly payment amount, I couldn't believe that I was told that another $35\/month was required for maintenance. No mention was made during the initial negotiation. I tried multiple times to exclude the service contract from my lease deal, but it pushed as required. I basically gave up.\nc. Then I noticed the contract specified .15 mile excess in one place and .20 in another place. The finance rep told us the excess mileage penalty was based on the msrp of the car. I said OK, please fix it. He went to his superior, came back with a different explanation. Again, not acceptable. If you know the answer great, if you don't, say that you don't know and get back to us. \nSo after all was said and done, Shane gave us a very detailed walk through of the features. We're happy with the car, yet the experience has left a bad taste.\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DO EVERYTHING TO AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP. Its not worth it.","useful":19,"funny":1,"cool":2},

Of course I went here as I was in AZ on a business trip, and was staying not far from this place. I was in my hotel room (thinking about just ordering room service), when someone I knew had posted a comment about the Kitchen Nightmare episode on FB. I then decided to look up the episode on HULU (this was not long after airing), then realizing I was not far from there, I decided to go. Uggg... I could tell just walking in that the kitchen was in distress. The old guy was sweating like a fat man in a marathon behind the touch screen computer. He had several tickets in his hand, and was having trouble with the technology. There were shouts from the back and a lot of loud banging from the kitchen. I noticed only one table had their entrÃ©e. That table seem unimpressed with their food. one other table got some appetizer shortly after I was seated, I heard one person remark \"will I have to wait another 45min for my dinner\" The time frame got my attn., because it looked like a simple pita and hummus type appetizer.The old man responded curtly to this comment but with his accent I could not understand what he said. When he left the table, the group kinda snickered. There were like 2-3 other groups\/couples waiting that just had drinks. My waitress was very polite, and attentive she kept my glass full. I noticed she stayed away from a couple tables, until someone asked her to fill their water glass. She did as asked, and the old man noticed and scolded her telling her that they were HIS customers, and she is NOT to serve them. Even when the customer tried to explain to him that he just wanted some water, the old man responded \"You do not tell me how to run my business! I am the boss here you are not.. if you want water you have to come through me, not her...\" I then realized why she avoided those tables. My order was taken... I ordered the Chicken Parm. \nI waited for a while, even though I fully intended to, I forgot to mark the time I placed my order, but it seemed like an eternity when I did start clocking (I imagine 15-20min later) still the waitress was kind, and kept my glass full. about 30 min later the old man placed and Eggplant Parm in front of me. He was still sweaty, and had some strong odors about him. At this point my sense of humor was thin, and when he placed the wrong dish in front of me I called him on the fact that I was her customer and not his. He argued with me insisting that he took my order for an Eggplant Parm. The table kinda caddy corner from me actually got up, and informed him that THEY had ordered that dish over an hour ago, and that they herd me order the Chicken parm. The old man continued to argue till the waitress had to confirm my order with the original hand written ticket. I will say at that point, the old man said \"I am sorry, but you know how it is... it is confusing...\" The other customer and I rolled our eyes he sat at his table with his wife (who had no food in front of her) and I returned to waiting. Well I got my meal the same time the other gentleman's wife got hers - about 15min later. \nMy meal was an undercooked chicken that was supposed to be baked, but somehow was greasy. and when I mean undercooked, the thick part of the chicken was RAW, BLOODY RAW! It was NOT crispy the breading was soggy, mostly from the weird pasta situation. It looked as if they used a non slotted spoon to pull the pasta from the pot, because there was A LOT of water on my plate. and I am not sure the physics behind this, but somehow, they managed to have both overcooked and undercooked pasta on my plate. As if they cooked left over pasta, with new (dry) noodles! Some of the pasta was like mush, and some of it was crunchy. This meal could have killed me had I eaten it!\nThe other couple was served the Eggplant Parm, then 15 min later she was served (I think it was a salad ) As a gentleman would, he did not start his meal till his wife was served. When they started eating the wife threw her fork on the plate and said, I can't take another bite of this $%!+ ! The husbands eyes and mine caught each others. He came to my table with his plate in hand. He asked me to taste his Eggplant Parm. I tried to cut his Eggplant Parm, but it was REAL tough, I managed to get a small piece, and it tasted like dirt - literally! We both took our complaint to the old man, and he started arguing with us concerning the quality of his food. I pointed out the blood, he said \"Good! Hope it kills you, then you will never bother me again\". The other couple slipped out, didn't pay the check (don't blame them) but that left me - the old man insisted that I not only pay my tab, but the other couples too. I pulled out a $20, threw it on the table and left! I was chased out the restaurant by both of them. I went to the Pita Jungle and had a much more positive experience there (The other couple was there when I arrived with a full meal in front of them. This place is a HECK NO!","useful":69,"funny":46,"cool":15},

Unfortunately the Luxor was the worst one we have been in.  I know our stay may have just been an unlucky visit.  However, so many things went wrong.  There is a big difference from a 3 star hotel, and the 4 and above.\n\nWhen we got into the elevator there was an old lady trying to get to her floor.  Her card didn't work properly.  After we talked to her, she had been up and down 3 times and it kept passing her floor.  We used our card and it passed it once.  Finally it allowed us to got off on our floor.  Not sure about the old lady, because she was still on it when we left. \n\nThe room is okay.  We stayed in the original building, not the tower.  Supposedly the tower is newer.  We wanted the feel of the original building.  The bathroom is good.  The biggest problem I had with the room was that there was a table spoon size yellow stain right on top of the sheet\/comforter.  I say sheet\/comforter, because it isn't a comforter, but thicker than a sheet.  Luckily its warm enough to not need a comforter.  Any how, if I can see a stain on the comforter when I walk in, then it should have been noticed by those cleaning the room.  \n\nAfter we settled down we wanted to watch tv.  First off all hotels in Las Vegas should have a tv larger than 19 inches, and I would expect a flat screen.  Guess that's why they are not rated 4 stars.  Then again it is probably so you go out and gamble more.  We tried using the tv but that batteries didn't work.  It was too late to worry about getting batteries or using the small buttons on the tv for it to work.  \n\nThe internet is wired.  They haven't figured out technology for wireless yet.  It would cost too much to do that.  \n\nWe later used the elevators again.  Once again they didn't work properly.  Someone else was stuck on it again.  Don't follow the directions on how they tell you to use them.  It says to remove card quickly.  If you do, expect to be on there for a while.  \n\nAnyway, I would have rated it with one star, but the people at the front desk are really friendly.  Plus, the beds are really really soft.

Apparently when it was at Aria it was a fabulous show and from the pictures on the website it looks like there is about 20 cast members, however last night there was the \"Star\" who was some REALLY high chick named Daisy from Brett Michaels Rock of Love on VH1 who was too tweaked out to remember the words to the 3 songs she \"sang\"..she sounded like a cat getting stepped on..it was so horrible the crowd, all 20 of us, actually groaned when she kept coming out...it was embarrassing.  Planet Hollywood is definitely not going to gain any positive word of mouth with that trash as their \"star\"...There was a total of 5 cast members, a man dancer, 3 female dancers, the trash \"star\" and a wonderful singer.. so I don't understand the video on the planet hollywood website that shows like 20 cast members with fire dances, acrobats, large production numbers, and men dancers..so not true...it is totally false advertising... it is a CHEAP knock off of the movie Burlesque and none of the dancers even had a burlesque type body and just danced like glorified strippers, they were incredibly skinny and out of sync.. The 1 star I gave this show was for the young lady billed as \"my singer\"\"...she was on America's Got Talent...She is an AMAZING singer, just as good as Christina Aquilera,  and is totally wasting her talent and time on this crap show.\n\nthe venue: \nthe venue was disgustingly dirty, it even smelled funny.  Before the show starts you are herded into a holding area, they call it a bar, where the tiny drinks start at $15!!  Then you watch the previous show exit down the steeeeeeeep 4 flights of stairs just waiting for someone to kill themselves on them.  You MUST enter the theater by walking up these 4 dangerous flights of stairs (I never saw an elevator, that is illegal isn't it?) and there are no assigned seat numbers, you are just placed in a row crammed next to each other, and then waitress rudely instructed me I was not allowed to put my drink in the drink holder, that was built into the arm of the chair, because it may spill. (WHAT?!?!)...my show had a total of 3 rows of patrons, maybe 20 people and now I know why..and when i picked up my tiockets the person asked me for my email and phone number and when i got home, that person had signed me up for an account which sent spam emails...I am so, so, so embarrassed for planet hollywood, not good business practices guys","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Its discouraging to pay $6+ for a drink and get syrup and flavored fillers.  On the positive side, they have expanded their craft beer selection and have a very nice selection both draft and bottle.  They also have a great appetizer selection and all are excellent.  Their entree selection is fair and needs rotated.  However, we have been pleased with the quality and quantity of food we have had.

My girls have had positive coaches and lots of fun.  I like that they see the team practicing when they are there so they can see what dedication and talent those girls have. I also like that they have several levels that your child moves up so they feel a sense of accomplishment.  Every few sessions they evaluate your child and the skills they have as mastered, still working or beginning.  I feel like kids can progress and the coaches are aware of when the kids are ready to do so. My girls have moved up 4 levels since we started.  When they are ready to move up, they do, they don't have to even wait for the next session.  Since we do recreational gymmastics, I feel it has been an excellent balance of conditioning , skills, and fun that keeps my girls looking forward to going to gymnastics for over 2 years now!

A quick google search and a check on Yelp led me to Orchid Pastry, a locally owned shop in a strip mall on Centre street not too far from my house. Their website gave me a good idea of the types of pastries they offer, and I was sold when I saw that they make a tiramisu cake with real fresh cream. I ordered a 1\/2 sheet for $70 which could probably feed about 35 people and was very impressed when I went to go pick it up. The cake was gorgeous, and the flavour was everything I had been dreaming about since I ordered the cake a few days earlier. Light, fluffy layers of cake sandwiched between light, creamy layers of espresso flavored tiramisu goodness. Everyone at the party loved it (most importantly, my mother), and wanted to know where it came from. I was happy to refer them to Orchid.

AND there's nothing a little A1 and ketchup couldn't fix. \n\nFor what it is, I can't complain.  You get a whole lotta bang for not a lotta bucks.   I say you pocket the savings and go help support the local dance bars, win win for all.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I cannot say much more about this company than that it is simply the best plumbing service I've ever received. The customer service is on point. I love how they follow up with you after the service they've done for you. The follow up calls are great bc it shows that they really about their customers and their work. I can see they take a lot of pride in their service and follow through till the end. Also, I love how they are 24\/7 for emergency needs or to simply talk to a professional on the phone to troubleshoot the problem. \nJust today I received a card from them with a Starbucks gift card and magnet from Pure Plumbing. What other company does that?? \nI recommend Pure Plumbing to anyone who wants fast and efficient service with their plumbing needs. Can't say more than that they are wonderful and has helped solved our plumbing problems!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They have excellent customer service at Longo. When you come in you are greeted right away by people who value their customers. They ask you what you needed done and if you have any concerns. They ask you if you need a ride somewhere incase you don't want to wait and if you are waiting they will direct you to their lounge and inform you of all the amenities that they have. If they told you it will be done in 45mins it usually gets done. But if not you usually get a call informing you of the situation and apologizing for making you wait more than you should. After your car service the service manager will approach (if waiting) and let you know your car service is done. He will CLEARLY explain everything that was done to your car  and inform you if there is something else that needed to be done right away or in the near future. \n\nAll of these things i mentioned are lacking at Centennial Toyota. Basically they just ask you what you need done and they take your info and your keys. After service is done they call you and get the payment and have you on your way. All of this is mediocre service. \n\nAt 34k miles i had my van serviced at centennial toyota which includes tire rotation. And at 39k i was having the tires replaced at discount tires and was shocked at what i saw. All 4 tires were worn out and cracked on the inside wall (not visible unless you remove tire). The steel belts were visible and protruding out. I knew they were worn out but i didnt know they were that bad. The guy at Discount Tires told me that i was lucky it didnt rupture. He also told me that this kind of damage didnt happen overnight. That if i had the car serviced 34k miles they should have noticed the problem and should have informed me. \n\nImmediately after having the tires replaced I went to Centennial Toyota to get an explanation from them. Why is it that they never informed me how seriuosly worn out my tires were. And all i got from them was this answer \"I'm sorry but we cannot bring back the past and see exactly what the person handling your service told you or didnt tell you. There are no video cameras here to substantiate your claim that you were not informed about your tires\". \n\nSo to everyone reading this, if you value your safety and the safety of your family\/passengers DO NOT BRING you car for service here!!!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},
