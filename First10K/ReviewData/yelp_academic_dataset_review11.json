Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.\n\nIn order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.\n\nGot the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.\n\nThe rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it.","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":1},

If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. \n\nHad the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. \n\nAs others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.\nThe serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. \n\nAll in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours.

Made the best garlic bread from the rest. One star removed for sloooooow service and rather overpriced selections of other things, but man their pastries are good. Sandwiches can be hit or miss and heavy.

Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar\/dessert\/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.\n\nNaan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.\n\nveggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.\n\npekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.\n\npalak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce\n\nkidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.\n\ntandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)\n\nlemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.\n\nchicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.\n\nThe interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic\/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against\/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).\n\nFeels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want\/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth the splurge.  I recommend that you look at everything first and then decide what to get, because you can't possibly try everything.

DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, dÃ©cor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate\/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.  She also doesn't tell you what the extra fees will be for signs, email blasts, etc.  Very deceptive.","useful":16,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.  You have to pay extra to get faster than a 1 mg speed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The restaurant is not air conditioned so be ready to sweat buckets. Food is overpriced for what you get--$45, before tax and tip, for a cocktail, a plate of nachos split 4 ways, and 3 of the smallest soft shell tacos I've ever seen. We're talking maybe 3 inches in diameter.\n\nNachos are not served with anything, guacamole, sour cream and salsa is all extra. Guacamole is also listed as \"Market price\"? Weird. Steak tacos were cold and chewy.\n\nBeware the service--likely from the owner. After our nachos he came by, tossed all of our food to the right of the table without saying anything (he knocked over the bowl of guacamole and shoved my arm in the process) and then promptly sat a family of four...right at our table. I've never experienced something so incredibly awkward and bizarre. He took our water jug, put it on their side, then took our water glasses--which I drank out of--and put it in front of them. That family somehow got their tacos before we did, ate, left, then another group of 3 came and were seated right at our table--elbow to elbow--again.\n\nNever, ever going back here. Terrible food and most awkward, uncomfortable dining experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Completely startled we all glance at each other wondering if that really just happened. Followed by 2 other moms I walk to the room, concerned. When i asked Coach Shauna what was wrong she told me that the girls were just not listening. I told her that if she ever has a problem with my daughter to send her out of class, that i am always in the other room and that i do not approve of her yelling at her. the other mothers also voiced their concern in which Coach Shauna replied &quot;if you dont want your kid in my class they don't have to be&quot; Hello?! Last I knew I payed to have my kid in this class and never once did I sign her up to be disciplined especially in that manner! After requesting to speak with the manager about the incident and them returning my call after they reviewed the tape i was informed that they cant have the class disrupted.

We made an appointment to meet with the maintenance personnel to do a walk-through of the place before leaving because we had heard that the complex was unfairly keeping people's security deposits.  After the walk-through, the maintenance person said everything was fine.  The carpet was vacuumed and everything was clean.  Then, 3 weeks later I get my security deposit notice-  that they have taken my deposit and they want me to pay $75.00 beyond it.  \n\nManagement told me there was nothing I could do about it.  I also had issues with rude management during an extension of my lease and adding somebody onto the lease.  I escalated the case to rkproperties management and they claimed that they took pictures of stains on carpets.  Also, my roommate had opened the microwave one day and a piece of the top fell off . . .just fell off!  We were told that it was 'damaged' above normal wear and tear and the maintenance personnel's word was the last.  Since when is opening a microwave door 'damage?'  It was probably broken before we even moved in.  Again, we were told that the maintenance personnel had the last word.  Seriously?

I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. \n\nAs for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. \n\nMy co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. And the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. None the less, when the first problem happened I was told that if trouble persisted I would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. I wasn't placed in a different vehicle. This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. I will not be replacing the engine. \n    This vehicle has not been reliable.

I understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. Unfortunately I cannot say my experience was among them. I paid for a 3 month warranty that refused to cover repairs that were included in the warranty agreement. \n    So here is my revised and updated review. Unfortunately I don't feel I can change my rating due to all I have experienced.","useful":11,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The only ice cream I ever eat now is Baskin Robbins' Cookies and Cream!  It's the only place I ever go to if I'm craving ice cream.\n\nHowever, I experienced the worst service at this location which is around St. Patrick's station downtown.  The employee there was so rude.\nSo, my friend and I came into the store first.  No greeting.  I mean, whatever, nothing too big to complain about.  We were browsing the flavours when two other girls came into the store.  The employee then talked to them and they seemed to be friends.  After two minutes, we were ready to order and the employee was still talking to the two girls for around 5-10 minutes.  She also served them first! (Ha!)  It wasn't until her friend stopped (annoyed) and pointed at us, whispering, apparently signalling for her friend (the employee) to go and serve us.  The employee also looked annoyed that she had to stop her conversation 'cus we wanted to order something... so anyway, we asked her if she had the Cookies & Cream flavour and she just replied, \"No.\"  That's it!  and then she went back to her friends.  She didn't even say, \"Sorry\" \"Do you want anything else\" and she didn't even ask my friend who was actually ready to order her Pistachio ice cream.  She just said one word and went back to talk to her friends.  \n\nIt was like we weren't even there!  I find it so rude to be treated as if you don't even exist.  It's so much worse than being given attitude...at least the person acknowledges your presence.  I will NEVER go to this location again.

I have been driving back and forth 2 hours to go back to Tiffin to visit, then trying to catch the barber's free time between the appointments. \n\nLong story short. I have to get a hair cut by today, can't wait due to scheduling issue. Found this one near by, decided to give it a try. \n\nSgro's doesn't go by appointments. I walked in around 5:05, the shop closes at 5:30. They took their time to meet my specific request for my hair style. By the time was done, it was already pass the closing time. The outcome is clean and neat. \n\nThey really know their stuff. \n\nNow, one more place to go for my haircut, and will go back again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
