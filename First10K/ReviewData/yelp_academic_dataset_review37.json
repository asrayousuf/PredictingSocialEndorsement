Our favorites are the crab stack appetizer (amazing crab meat with spices, mango, jalapeno, and avocado with a lemon avocado oil), the wet carnitas burrito (really, it's a GREAT burrito!), and the quinoa is an unusual and sophisticated side with interesting flavors.  The short ribs barbacoa are a great GF option. \n Our kids (one of whom is a VERY picky eater) like everything they've tried, and Sol has no problem splitting an adult meal between kids.  As for the TEQUILA, it's a great selection if you're an aficionado, and upscaled everyday margs if you're not.  I love the frozen margarita with fresh muddled berries (they have all kinds).  All drinks are made from scratch and to order, but it's worth the short wait.  If you love mimosas, ask for the FroMo, which is orange juice and prosecco, mixed with frozen margarita.....DELICIOUS and yummy at any meal!

The room smelled stale and had the charm of a Prison cell.\n\nWe had a really large room - which I guess they try to make up for the proximity to the street, the construction site next door, the driveway adjacent to the other side of the room, the inoperable windows,the fact that the walls are stone - no drapes to help with acoustics (just shutters) - which makes for a great sound chamber for unmufflered motorcycles at 3 am.  The Bathroom doors were shutter type - I guess great for ventilation but hello?  privacy?  \n\nAdding to the charm, the Building lights shone right into our undraped windows, the TV had horrible sound and the shower drain was backed up.\n\nAll of the hotel room doors are \"open air\" - completely accessible to the street.  I am not necessarily creeped out about this.  Scottsdale seems pretty safe - but it couldn't have hurt with the acoustic problem.\n\nWe asked for another room.  Can't blame the staff but they didn't seem eager to please.  The guy on 4 am duty when we checked out seemed cool though.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had such a good experience that I started having my oil changes and smog checks done there as well. Last Friday 10.31.14 I stopped in to have my oil changed without an appointment, they were very busy so i decide to make an appointment, the attendant suggested to me that Sunday was their slowest day so I made an appointment for 8 am Sunday morning.\nI arrived at 8:02 am to find 5 people in front of me to drop off my keys and only one person attending to people, not a big deal they got busy, I understand. In listening to the people in front of me I realized that none of them had appointments so when I got to the counter at 8:20, just to drop off my keys I asked if what the man on Friday had told me would still be true, that I would be out of there by 9:00 AM? \nHe said that I was not on time and now there were many people in front of me. I said again I have an appointment and I WAS there on time and had been standing in line for 20 minutes and I want to make sure that I would  be in front of the people that did not have appointments?\n\nHe told me again that I was not there on time, I said I was there on time and had been standing in line for 20 minutes which he clearly knew. He then started to argue with me about what time I arrived in front of the whole room full of people, stating I was not in line when he opened the doors at 8 am, which i was not. I was there at 8:02 am.\nI again said I just wanted to make sure that since I had an appointment that my car would be serviced before those that did not bother to make and appointment. He then went on a rant a bout how whenever he has an appointment he is there on time etc. He just wanted to argue IMO.\n\nWhen I made the appointment on Friday I asked the attendant at the time what the earliest was that I could drop off the car and he told me 8 am, I didn't realize at the time that making an appointment to help them with their staff scheduling was a waste of my time and that it all depends on your place in the line before the place even opens. I then asked for my keys and said we were just going to leave. He then made a some comment about not being able to do magic. Basically a good riddance.\n\nKeep in mind all i did was ask the question, not in a confrontational way at all, I just needed to  verify that my appointment would still put me in front of the walk-ins as it should. I have since discovered that he is the manager and  that he has a history of rude and unprofessional  behavior. I took the car to Freddy's and paid more for the work which I am happy to do for good customer service. It got in at Freddy's right away.\n\nBottom line? Avoid this location unless you like abuse and very poor customer service should you be unlucky enough to get this guy. it had been about 3 months since I was last there so I don't know if this guy is new or what but my experience definitely changed.\n\nFYI, everyone else I have ever dealt with at  this location was great. I feel sorry for them working for this man.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We hired this company because the came in with the low bid among several highly regarded landscape companies that we interviewed. In retrospect, we really regret this decision. \n\nFirst, the small stuff. After they seeded the lawn, wind blew much of the seeds into the mulch beds where the grass grew much better than it did where it was supposed to grow. It's been a couple of growing seasons and our grass hasn't fully taken off, largely because I suspect they didn't use enough top soil. It would have been nice if they had checked back with us to see whether the seeding was successful. \n\nMany of the shrubs that they planted have failed (some were replaced under warranty). Again, I suspect inadequate topsoil is at least partly to blame. \n\nThe garden trellis that they built initially was flimsy, collapsed and had to be replaced. \n\nFinally, they built a large patio out of pavers. This project was a substantial investment on our part. Within a year, the patio collapsed into a hole. When they came out to look at the job, they claimed that there must be some issue below the surface and thus was not their fault. They then presented us with a large estimate for repairing the patio. Because we were dissatisfied with their services all around, we sought alternative bids for fixing the project and went with a different company to repair it. During the repairs, the entire patio had to be excavated and we found evidence that the base underneath the patio had not been properly compacted (as required by the paver company). Moreover, there is other evidence that the patio was improperly installed in terms of the sand that was put in between the pavers. That sand began washing away shortly after installation and will take several thousand dollars to redo. \n\nSo, it was bad enough that our project had so many failures, some of which have involved very expensive fixes, but what was most disappointing was the unsympathetic and utterly unhelpful response on the part of Herman Landscaping.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

When making the reservation I was looking forward to the opportunity to try out one of the few hotels of Harrahs I have not stayed at yet, as my family and I regularly stay at Caesars, Flamingo, Ballys and Harrahs in both Vegas and Laughlin. In addition, I know Planet Hollywood has a reputation for catering to a younger crowd. \n\nUpon arrival, we were forced to drive around the poorly designed parking structure for over 10 minutes trying to find a spot - unacceptable for the hotel, casino and shopping experience the Planet Hollywood claims to be. Once parked, we made the 15 minute, very confusing, trek with our luggage to hotel check-in. Not only were there very few signs directing us on how to get to hotel check-in from the parking structure, we were faced with 2-3 uneducated employees who each pointed us in a different direction. One employee simply responded \"who knows I have only worked here a week\". \n\nOnce arriving at hotel check-in, we were told we would be upgraded to a \"strip view\" room with a view of the Bellagio fountains, needless to say we were ecstatic as it was both mine and my boyfriends first stay at this hotel. This excitement was short lived, upon arriving to the room we found the furniture covered in what looked to be body fluid stains, poorly patched up holes in the bathroom doors, a dirty sink and tub, chipped & damaged furniture, a television without a working remote, a noisey toilet that kept running our ENTIRE stay, etc. I really could go on and on. In addition to all these, we were disappointed to learn our \"Strip View\" was out of a dirty window smaller than our television screen. I feel sorry for your guests who actually pay for this upgrade expecting a \"view\". \n\nWe put all this past us and went down to the Miracle Mile shops for some shopping, dinner and drinks. Again, we were presented with uneducated staff who couldn't tell us where Fat Tuesdays, Victoria's Secret, or if there was a Bath and Body Works located in the mall - we were simply told \"I don't know, go find a map\". The only person who was of any assistance to us was one of the non-english speaking janitors who my boyfriend was able to communicate with in spanish and could properly direct us to Fat Tuesdays. \n\nUpon arriving back to our room around 6am, we were kept awake by what sounded like trucks driving over our room, we then realized that the monorail drives behind Planet Hollywood and what I am to assume to be directly above or behind our room. In addition to this, we were disgusted by the ill fitting sheet on our king size bed, which left a large piece of mattress uncovered at the foot of our bed, because of this we were forced to sleep with on top of the sheets without covers. We finally gave up and joined my family who were smart enough to stay at the South Point Hotel. We spent most of our day there getting some rest and real relaxation. We went back to our room at Planet Hollywood around 4pm on Saturday to again hear the non-stop monorail. \n\nWe went downstairs to give shopping and dinner in the miracle mile shops another try. We went to the Cabo Wabo restaurant and received some of the WORST service I have ever experienced. Both my boyfriend and I have worked in restaurants while going through college, both of us being Corporate Trainers for well known, national restaurant chains - the service we received was UNACCEPTABLE. We had to ask for my drink 3 times because our server kept forgetting it, my boyfriend's food came out covered in cheese even though we requested it without (as he is lactose intolerant, which we told the server) and when we asked one of the hostesses where we could find the \"rain show\" she responded \"I don't know I don't work in the mall\" which was confusing to us as Cabo Wabo is listed as being located in the Miracle Mile shops. \n\nWe gave up and went back to the room around 11pm and forced ourselves to sleep through the noise of the running toilet and monorail. We awoke at 8am the next morning almost immoble from the completely worn in bed. I travel quite a bit for work and have NEVER woken up in so much pain from a mattress. \n\nI am extremely disappointed in the Planet Hollywood and the Harrah's Corporation for allowing an experience like this. I have had great experiences in the past with your other hotels but am at the point where I don't feel I could ever stay at another Harrah's resort. I spent $250 on a room that I could barely spend any time in. I will NEVER stay at the Planet Hollywood again and most likely will NEVER stay at another Harrah's Corp hotel again. For an industry based on customer service and a great customer experience the Harrah's Corporation has failed! Like I state in my subject I am very disappointed and upset I spent my hard earned money on such a terrible experience.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":2},

So we decided on a couple others and before we know it, here comes a forgotten app and 2 huge 10 PIECE rolls that we could not possibly finish! Great sushi but heres the kicker...we were asked immediately if its our first time, if we lived near, how we found them, THEN each question over again! We were told we would need to pay for what we didnt eat...we honestly felt like we were in trouble for not finishing our plates!

But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots. \n\nWe decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock. \n\nBy 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say. \n\nFinally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing. \n\nOn top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it. Guess we'll have to find someone else to use our $25 certificate. Any takers?","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Mike is not your regular cookie-cutter trainer from one of the big warehouse gyms. Mike is a trainer's trainer (he literally trains other fitness trainers) and he REALLY knows his stuff.\n\nWhether you are an elite athlete looking to stretch yourself to the limit or just looking to drop some weight or get in shape, Mike and his staff will tailor make a program to fit your goals. They focus on real-life, functional fitness and have a huge bag of tricks to help you get where you want to go. You'll be blown away with some of the stuff they do here. Mike is also great at working with kids and young athletes, so you can bring them too.\n\nThe best thing about Raw Fitness is the warmness of the staff. They aren't there to just to get you in and out as quickly as possible. They really do care about you and want to help you achieve a better quality of life by improving your health. If you are willing to show up and put in the work, they WILL help you get results.\n\nI have never been in better shape than when I was working out with Mike. I almost want to move back to NC just so I can work with him again. If Mike can take a pencil-necked guy like me and turn him into a powerful fitness machine, he can do it for you too. Drop by sometime or give him a call and ask him to hook you up with a free session.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

They're Arizona-based, so if you live here, why not patronize their business? The money is still staying in your state. Most chains are bad news and grace the armpits of major cities like rampant pubic lice (also known as \"strip mall Hells\"), but these guys might restore your faith in that all-too-often abused model, a little.\n\nSomehow, though, they still reminded me a bit of a tiny Souplantation where the food is brought to you and the menu is innovative. It's probably just the pale wood interior and glass sneeze guards. But these people are reviving the ancient art of breadmaking and turning it into something trendy and accessible to people who don't eat at anything but chains. ( I saw a picture of someone making bread in a book in an antique shop once.) They need at least some kudos for this. \n\nOn to my meal: the Caribbean Jerk chicken salad is pretty darned good. I didn't find it spicy enough, and I would have put fresh thyme, some shallots, scotch bonnet peppers, and the tiniest breath of allspice in it, but I did field research in the Caribbean and know how that stuff is supposed to taste. This was the first Caribbean jerk anything that I've ordered on any menu and didn't find deeply disappointing. The size of the salad was perfect--not too big (salads don't keep well as leftovers), and not too small (it was sufficiently filling and I'm 6'3\"). The pieces of nondescript bread on the side were homemade, so how could I complain?\n\nMy wife's roast beef with gorgonzola cheese was gone before I could demand my own bite. Her little sister's roasted sweet potato sandwich (carb-on-carb seemed redundant, but what else can vegetarians really eat?) was also much appreciated by the little sis, and was gone before I could bully the slightest smidgen out of her. There wasn't much service, but it was fast; the atmosphere was industrial, but I saw a lot of cool combinations of ingredients. \n\nI would have liked to have seen less of a \"we're trying to make mega bank and stick only to things we know we do well\" atmosphere, but a chain is a chain to some degree. There are also very few items for people with gluten allergies or who can't eat bread. But for lunch on a Sunday afternoon in strip mall Hell, this place was more than adequate, earning it an \"A-OK\" rating of three stars. Most chains have a repulsive formula, but this chain's formula is far less odious than most.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

I have very fine eyebrow hairs and went to Julia for microblading in the hopes of having beautiful, hassle-free eyebrows.  The result is that I am emotionally distraught and aesthetically maimed with mis-matched eyebrows now because of Julia's work.\n\nI take responsibility for not doing significantly more research before deciding on someone to do my microblading, or I certainly would not have selected Julia.  She lacks close-up photos of her work, has only 3 reviews on Yelp, and not many more on her website where she can cherry-pick the best ones.  But shame on Julia for trying to convince me that her microblading on my brows looked great, and that what I was seeing in the mirror was \"just a reflection\" and not what my brows really looked like.  Her analysis would be laughable if it was not so flawed and deeply upsetting.\n\nI last saw Julia about a month ago for a touch-up to the original work where she promised to \"even out my brows and make them perfect.\" She did not improve the mismatched shapes at all, but only made them darker which I did not want.  Since then I have had numerous consulting appointments with professional microbladers and have heard a consistent theme to date... that my brows are definitely mismatched with one having a high arch mid-way in the brow, while the other is relatively flat with a rounded arch at the end; additionally, I've been told the brows are over-saturated so that the individual hairs are not visible which is the whole point of microblading to achieve natural looking brows.\n\nI can only pray that my brows lighten and completely disappear over the next few years.  At that point, if they have not completely faded, I will need to resort to time-consuming and expensive saline treatments to remove Julia's work before I can have my brows properly microbladed.  \n\nIn the meantime, each morning I must re-shape each brow with a brow pencil to get a closer match so that I'm not embarrassed to go out.  Needless to say, the past several months have been emotionally devastating to me and I don't know what the future holds.\n\nJulia has offered to \"fix my brows\" if I come in for a third appointment.  In my opinion I would be crazy to let her work on me again given the outcome of my first two visits.  The damage is done.\n\nBuyer beware.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat.

I love Olive Garden's menu, so we dine out at the chain somewhat regularly.  We went to this particular restaurant yesterday for a dinner with an elderly relative.  I suppose when we walked in, they profiled us and didn't feel we merited any kind of special or polite treatment.  We were led to the most cramped, dingy and dark booth I had ever seen in an Olive Garden restaurant, where the lighting was so bad, we couldn't even see our menus.  Our server was Sergio, and he was just going through the motions--quite badly.  He didn't smile once, or come back and ask us how we were doing.  He brought the salad, and then we didn't see him for a half hour or more.  Then he came and picked up our salad plates before he served our entrees and actually left the dirty salad plates on the tray beside our cramped dungeon-like table for a long time.  To top everything off, the family behind us were the rudest, most uncouth trash I have heard or seen in some time--they need their own reality show on some trashy network.  Their 2 or 3 year old brat was allowed to screech inhumanly for their whole meal, which unfortunately overlapped ours.  When we finally got our food, it was hot (unbelievably) and tasty, but everything else about the visit was a complete and total fail.  I would be surprised to imagine that the Olive Garden franchise can condone this kind of service and atmosphere.  Luckily I was just traveling through and don't have to ever eat at this hellhole again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},
