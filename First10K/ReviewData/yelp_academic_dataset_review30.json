I'm always a little suspicious of somewhere with perfect reviews, but I experienced it myself. Making an appointment online was easy and the in-store experience was exceptional. \n\nForget all the other mall based jewelry stores, Dave's concept cuts out the middle men and high rent costs to give you the best price. He has the coolest software - you can actually see and design anything you can think of, common or unique, right while you're sitting there. Want to see the diamond you pick with a halo surround? Sure! Want to take it off and try side stones instead? No problem. No need for sketches, wax moulds or your imagination, you can see it in seconds and change it and customize it endlessly.\n\nWe were only in Vegas for the weekend so we couldn't buy right away, but that didn't change how Dave treated us - he was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly with no pressure. He genuinely wanted us to get what we wanted and for us to be happy. We'll be back. You won't find a better place to buy diamonds and jewelry in Las Vegas.\n\nThe worst part of buying a custom ring is hoping it looks like what you have in your head. With Dave, you don't need to guess. See the picture for the rendering you get to see right while you're sitting in his office.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My next favorite was the scallop au gratin, I believe it had bacon in it and the mushrooms were incredibly fresh. The fried zucchini comes with a delicious marinara that really enhanced the flavor.

It is such a great place to get some exercise and enjoy AZ! I take my dog for a trail run about every other week and always seem to find a new trail to explore (that may be because the trails aren't marked very well, but I can always find my way back to the car). I have to say the maps at the trail heads are a bit washed out, so before the \"smart phone\" I had a difficult time determining how far I had actually hiked. Now that I have the cardio trainer on my Droid I can see I was padding my workouts juuuuust a bit... :) \n\nTrails can vary from easy to intense, depending on how hard you push yourself. You can get a great workout or enjoy a nice stroll, makes it a great place to take out-of-towners. \n\nParking is good in the summer (of course) and decent in the spring and fall. Expect to walk a bit to the trail head, especially in the winter - but that is what you are there for!

We have always brought our out of town guests there for gaming and food.  The quality of your food has steadily declined since we started coming to what is now inedible.  The prime rib is now a low quality, tough,  underdone steamship round; the tempura shrimp is 'popcorn shrimp' , a dried out bland product that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the shellfish; the seafood fra diavolo is now skimpily scattered atop an overdone spaghetti and your caesar salad is overdressed and limp.  Without exception the other options available appeared to have been held on the steam table until past their prime.  In fairness, I didn't try the pizza.  I don't go to casino buffets for pizza.  Incredibly, while you've lowered quality you've discontinued the bounce-back BOGO that we've enjoyed since arriving here.  Regardless, the meal we had this evening, November 11 at 4:30pm was not worth half of what we paid.

Amazing level of service!  Likewise, the hygenist I have seen through repeated cleanings has knowledgeably guided me back to healthy gums with extremely practical suggestions (namely, water flosser) after a few years deferred dental care due to multiple moves left me with sensitive, receeding gumlines.

Community Tire first popped onto my radar as I was searching for the best prices in town for some bigger shoes for my truck - they appear to have great tire prices, and they have great reviews.  To try to keep a long story from being excessively long, I ended up buying some used tires elsewhere and also having my regular mechanic install some new struts to level out my ride in preparation for the new tires.  I knew there might be some fit issues and that I would need an alignment.  I scheduled this to be done at another prominent, well reviewed shop I won't name that \"specializes\" in jeep and truck lifts and aftermarket modifications.  They tried to mount the new larger tires but found they were rubbing on the upper control arm.  Knowing that other first generation Toyota Sequoia owners had successfully mounted the tire size I was looking to run with the addition of wheel spacers, I asked whether adding a 1.25\" wheel spacer would solve the clearance issue.  They said no, just can't make this work for your truck.  Since I knew this was incorrect, I didn't press the issue.  I get it - they just want to do their normal routine on jeeps and 4-runners.  And they completely lost all technical credibility with me.  I will just be on my way, thanks.  Oh, and I had also asked whether I would be able to mount this tire size in the normal spare location.  They said they checked it out and it wouldn't fit.  To their credit, they didn't charge me for their half-hearted, failed attempt.\n\nEnter Community Tire.  I called and made an appointment.  Arrived, wheel spacers and tires in hand, and explained the situation.  This should work, can you guys take a look and see if you can make it happen?  They test mounted one tire, bolted up the spacer and the wheel, and brought me out to show me the clearance.  Looked good, should work.  Finished it up, got everything aligned (lifetime alignment), and even managed to squeeze the upsized tire into the normal spare position.  Totally awesome, on my team, phenomenal service at every step!\n\nDrove it a bit and noticed a little bit of rub at near full-lock with the suspension a bit compressed.  Looked at some further information on various Toyota truck forums and determined the alignment specs might need some tweaking to solve the rub issue.  Called Community Tire back and they said bring it back in and bring your alignment specs, we'll take a look at it.  Now, these guys have been crazy busy every time I've been in.  Alignment rig occupied non-stop.  They get it up and try to get it to my specs and essentially redo the alignment.  No luck, no more caster adjustment left with my UCA's, but they tried.  And they wouldn't take any more money from me.  I insisted, knowing I had just used an hour of valuable alignment rig and tech time, but Kevin wouldn't hear it.  Amazing, old-fashioned, treat you like they really care service.  I've been telling everyone I know about Community Tire as occasions arise.  Getting service from them was a refreshingly outstanding experience.\n\nKevin answered the phone and handled my service visits.  Kevin rocks!  That place is a beehive of activity, with the phone ringing non-stop.  Even though a couple weeks had elapsed between my initial visit and return and he's probably seen and spoken with hundreds of people, he remembered me and the job and provided incredibly friendly, personalized service.  Everyone there seems great.  I didn't catch his name, but the tech was super friendly as well.  \n\nThe term \"Community\" in their name is meaningful and aptly used.

The AC was broken on and off throughout the AZ summer and the front desk would deny it was broken one day, then the next day a different person would admit it was broken and in process of being fixed.

Hoping the second time it might redeem itself. The food was not good at all. I had a BLT the first time and a chicken sandwich the second. Two things you think would be hard to mess up? Cold, the bacon looked like bacon bits from a can (was expecting fresh juicy, crispy bacon), the sauce that they put all over the chicken sandwich tasted like pure wasabi. In addition to this the service was poor both times, the restuarant was empty yet the service was lagging. The waiter would have 20 min conversations with people who clearly were trying to eat dinner and not interested in chatting, but just were being polite. All this while his 2 other tables (mine) and another couple sat and rolled there eyes at eachother.  They were out of major things on the menu. The presentation of the food could use work as well. It just seems like this place is on the cusp of closing down and keeps changing the menu in hopes of it working but need to focus more on perfecting simple items on there initial menu, presentation and service rather than weak attempts to change the menu everytime they get a bad review on here.  The location is great, the interior is great, the patio wonderful. This actual structure has great potential. I know that this is owned by Frank and Lupes, which is excellent, so maybe they need to focus there efforts on one thing and not get too much in the hopper.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I loved the aquarium, the flowers, the variety of restaurants in the hotel even thought they were pricey. i wasn't afraid to spend money. i loved the pool it was huge and gorgeous! but you have to get there early or its hard to find an empty lounge chair if you have a few ppl in your group. \n\ni was disappointed that the pool closed at 7. I was disappointed in the bathroom size. i had a tower king room? the bathroom was tiny! i thought it would of been nicer than PH. so i figured i should stop comparing, but this room didn't even have a coffee maker.

We booked several months in advance, and knew that this would be a busy weekend in LV. We decided on staying at the Mirage based solely on their advertised offer of free entry to the Bare Pool for hotel guests before 12pm. We figured this was an adult weekend and we could use some rest and relaxation. We read some good reviews about Bare and decided to pursue it. The service was good, the food was decent for pool food, and the drinks were good, but overpriced- which is Vegas normal, I understand. The atmosphere was very relaxed, not unexpectedly small and more gents than ladies. We didn't really care about that since we went as a couple, but I mention it more as an FYI. There are two problems in particular that I am taking issue with. The first being that I was charged $50 to get in, in spite of the fact that this was totally contrary to what was advertised on their website. I mentioned to the 20-something kid at the register that this was the case and he acted like he could care less and said that's what it is because it's \"a busy weekend,\" end of discussion. I decided to pay anyway since our mind was already set on visiting this attraction, as was the other couple's that was with us. We all rented chairs (4 total) for $150 each, with the agreement that we needed to drink and eat the minimum price of the chairs or pay the difference. This was an aggressive goal but doable, so we proceeded. After agreeing to the chair rental, we were informed that we would also be charged tax and a mandatory 20% gratuity, which we had no problems with, but we could have been told beforehand in case we didn't like the ~35% increase in original quoted price. Regardless, our server was good and we tipped her more than what we had agreed to, but that's not where the second problem lies. Our otherwise good time was ruined by some \"Service Fee\" that was tacked on to our bill that was never once mentioned before our rental agreement. Really, what in the heck is a \"Service Fee?!\" We obviously paid for our food and drinks, and we generously tipped the server, why is there this surprise fee in addition to all of that? This came right at the very end when it was time to sign for the bill. I chose not argue about it since I am sure it would not have been taken off, so here I am warning all of you. Needless to say, we did not go back for the rest of our stay. The Mirage is supposed to be a world-class resort, and the stunts they pulled both with the FALSE ADVERTISING of free entry for guests and a surprise \"Service Fee\" after spending over $800 for several hours at the pool is just plain wrong. I could expect this type of poor treatment at a bordertown dive bar that is frequented by rowdy college kids, but for a property that prides itself on being a higher-end resort, like the Mirage, this is totally unacceptable!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

As soon as we put the deposit down for full wedding planning (although the site lists partial planning we were told this is no longer an option) her demeanor instantly changed. Just to give you an idea, the happiest day of my life, was actually the day after the wedding because I knew I would never have to contact or see Tara again.\n\nShe was a total nightmare to work with, at times I thought my whole experience with her was part of some romantic comedy - and that these things could not possibly happening to me based on the amount of time and money that we spent on her services and the wedding - from a melting wedding cake, to family heirlooms stolen from our home, to misplaced bouquets, to my vendors contacting me because she was always unavailable, to her yelling at my mother - it was all out some awful reality show. \n\nI was left alone my whole wedding day that included - having to keep the hair and makeup team on track, the photographer and videographer both of whom left early despite being paid for the night. The bridal party almost left the house without our bouquets for our photoshoot until I asked where  are the bouquets and my florist walked them over not Tara. She did have time to post photos of my wedding on instagram during the actual wedding  which I thought was in poor taste but a good example of her work ethic. \n\nFrom the start, Tara was unwilling to suggest or meet with vendors that did not fall under her one or two selection of preferred vendors usually her friends. I ended up having to do all the leg work though I haven't lived in Toronto for about sixteen years and work in Chicago which is why I hired a wedding planner locally: that included hair, makeup, cake, flowers, and food, and I had to hire, meet with, and negotiate all my own budgets and contracts. Even the simplest of tasks as finding a limo company and putting our guest list on a chalkboard became huge endeavors for her. \n\nMy hair and makeup team told me that they had never experienced a wedding planner who failed to interact with them or the bride the day of the wedding. Multiple guests asked if we had considered hiring a wedding planner due to many mishaps that occurred - honored guests not having a place sit for dinner, bridal party not receiving food or drinks, wine bottles that were purchased not being placed on the tables nor served the list goes on.\n\nThe day of the wedding, Tara insisted on coming at noon even though hair was arriving at 7:30 am and the set up for the wedding was incomplete. I had to insist she come in at 8:30 when she did arrive she was late 9:30 and then disappeared to the backyard as nothing was set up even though staff had access to the venue for four days in advance and everything had been delivered and ready for set up days beforehand but she was too busy with another event. \n\nIt took me almost three months to calm down enough to post a review, because the whole situation left me so distraught. I truly hope no on else makes the same mistake I did by trusting Bliss with planning a once in a lifetime occasion. \n\nFor additional Specifics read below:\n- Unable to meet after 2pm in the afternoon, does not respond to email or texts sometimes for weeks at a time. \n- Uses her kids as an excuse not to meet or email or text since she would have to pick them up for school or go on weekend trips. This made it extremely difficult to communicate with her or meet with potential vendors due to her limited availability. \n- Doesn't work with any assistants or at least in our case didn't have one, concerns and issues go unaddressed.\n- Budget finalized two days before the event after we had paid everything.\n- Errors in itinerary such as scheduling bridesmaid for hair first when she was not even in town as explained in five emails.\n- The catering staff unsupervised for the reception and did not serve the bridal party appetizers, or sides that includes me and my husband. \n- Fans were not ordered so my $1000 plus wedding cake melted and we had to use a regular knife to cut our cake, even though we paid her company thousands of dollars to rent all the utensils and serving utensils\n- sparkler exit did not happen despite buying sparklers\n- antique bone china was stolen from our home by hired staff\n- Failed to show up for the pick up of rental items after the wedding or assist in supervision of clean up, dissembling, and packing up of items. \n- Rental companies sent us invoices for missing items despite her company being in charge of what was ordered, delivered, and responsible for pick up we paid Bliss over 30,000 to act as middleman upon Tara's request.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I wanted to have my dog have comprehensive dental care completed under her care after my regular vet provided me with a full work up and referral for dental work. When I contacted Martin Vet to set up the procedure and provided them with his medical records no one responded to set up an appointment for over a week. After calling back and speaking with multiple staff, I finally heard back from Dr. Conway herself at 7 pm on New Year's Eve.\n\nShe called me on the verge of hysterics insisting that despite the referral from my general vet from a dental visit completed a week ago, and the urgent needs of my dog she needed to first examine the dog and charge for a consultation before scheduling an actual appointment. When I asked if any dental diagnostics could be completed at the consultation, she stated my dog would need to be sedated for that. So, I would have to wait another two weeks to treat my dogs dental needs.\n\nSince my dog recently just had a wellness exam, and the medical records were provided to the office, I asked if the consultation fee could be waived once I paid for the dental procedures and sedation. To my knowledge all medical professionals are expected to examine a patient prior to sedating them when asked regarding this issue, Dr. Conway angrily stated \"No, the day of the procedure we just check their temperature.\" This was very concerning to me and I would not seek care from an establishment that sedates dogs without doing a thorough work up the day of the procedure. \n\nAs a dentist for humans, I can tell you that without radiographs a dental diagnosis\/consultation cannot be given, so billing for a dental consult without radiographs and then billing again another separate fee for a dental exam under sedation, is unethical. No dental diagnosis can be obtained without radiographs. As well, it goes without saying that if anyone sedates your pet - a thorough exam should be conducted by the anesthesiologist performing the sedation, all medical records reviewed the day of the procedure rendering the consult performed by Dr. Conway unnecessary and inhumane as it delays the ability for a pet to be treated in a timely and compassionate manner. There are many options for vet care in Toronto, and this is not a place I would trust with my pets.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":0},

We said sure why not.Charcuterie was fine, the bread was table bread and cold.  When the Bill arrived and we noted that we had been charged for bread an the vegetables that we didn't order but the server suggested to bring. In the history of charcuterie I have never heard of it being served without warm toasted bread or brioche as a counterpart. \nWe were also billed three taxes: HST1 8.5%, HST 2 (5.5%), and also a final 13% tax surcharge. When we asked the server for change, she pocketed five dollars of the 120 dollars we gave her returning to us 115. I was extremely disappointed with the service we received and I am considering reporting the taxation that was utilized on our cheque which we took a picture of.
