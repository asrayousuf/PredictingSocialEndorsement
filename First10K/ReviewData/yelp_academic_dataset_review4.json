Just go wild. \n\nShrimp tacos were juicy and great \n\nFish taco was great and flaky \n\nThey had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)\n\nChicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded. \n\nThe Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful \n\n\nCeviche love the jalape√±o touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun. \n\n\nMargarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup....

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \n\nIn short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  \n\nNow, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.\n\n2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.

I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. \n\nBottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.\n\nI have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)\n\nI also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)\n\nGo here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. \n\nI believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid.

But I think they changed ownership (in fact I saw that they changed ownership-- at least that's what they're advertising in the Surprise weekly).  \n\nAnyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.\n\nLook, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.\n\nI've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  \n\nAnyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.\n\nSo I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.\n\nI've been going to this nail salon for years, I think 2 years.  They know me at this salon.  And to question me when I'm upset about something just doesn't make me happy.  \n\nI'm not going back to this salon.","useful":12,"funny":0,"cool":0},

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1\/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!!

Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style.

With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.\n- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing\n= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.\n\nBouldering area\n+ Decent number of routes and variety\n- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere\n\nTop rope area\n-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.\n- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +\/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?\n- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.\n- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.\n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I'm not sure if it works for other hotels as well.  the hotel is great location, great bathtub, comfy bed, good or great view of the strip depending on your room.  only downside is walls are thin. you can hear the next room so gotta keep the TV. turned up.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},
