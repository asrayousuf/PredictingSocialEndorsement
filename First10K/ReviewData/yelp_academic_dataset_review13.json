It wasn't very busy, so perhaps we had better service as a result, but either way my experience was good.\n\nBeer wasn't as over-priced as I expected - $6 for a pint of Heineken. \n\nI might check this place out again, to try some of the odder stuff on the menu.

We often go to Genghis Grill and love it so we wanted to try this. This doesn't even come close. The meats looked like frozen, rolled up lunch meat. Veggies looked ok. Wasn't really any taste to the bowl unless you drenched it in teriyaki and soy sauce. My man didn't even finish his food and that never happens. Even the frozen yogurt didn't taste very good.

I absolutely loved my time at this salon. I've never been the type to do a whole lot with my hair since its kind of a strange curl that's pretty thin. I made an appt with Nicole for a full color, hi-lites, and cut & style. I got there a little before my appt which was set for 11 and the salon was clean and absolutely adorable. Nicole came and introduced her self right at 11 and took her me to her station. She asked me what I wanted and I showed her a picture. My hair was previously dyed black and the picture was of a pretty honey brown with some hi-lites. She thoroughly explained why it really wouldn't be possible to do that color without damaging my hair and it possibly not even turning out well. She explained what might be a good alternative and I told her to go for it. She was conversational and made great conversation for the whole 3.5 hr appt. She ended up doing a full hi-lite with a toner and a cut. I absolutely LOVE how it turned out and have already received so many compliments on it. I also love the cut she did and she straightened it for me which is always a luxury since I don't do it myself. I walked out of the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks! I will definitely be going back frequently to see Nicole!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

He immediately offered to come out to our center with his daughter Denise to discuss the layout and finalize the menu.  He was the only caterer I spoke with , to offer that!\nThis past Saturday was the event , and it was fantastic! Denise, Joe Jr, and their team did an amazing job! The set ups were gorgeous, with flowers and color coordinated linens and beautifully presented food. Our guests raved to me about the quality and selection of foods and the beautiful dessert table.  Their staff were hard working , friendly professionals, that engaged with the guests in a lovely manner.  I can't recommend them enough and am delighted to know that we have found our \"go to\" caterer for our events. Thanks Joe, Miley, Denise, Joe Jr and your awesome team!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink, etc.). \n\nThe rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first.

I give the show three stars:\n\nFirst star is for the opening sequence. Just prior to the show the audience is treated to some acrobatic antics, and even a comedic reminder to stow the electronics. Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. \n\nSecond star is for great acrobatics with the \"death wheel\" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. \n\nThird star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. \n\nNow for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. \n\nSecond, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just \"OK\". There were \"wows\" and \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. \n\nAll in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where \"Too Much\" is often \"Just enough\", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1},

We agreed and added a mixed green salad. \n\nThe salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share. \n\nThis is Las Vegas and everything was pricey but for the value of the food and the experience and the absolutely amazing service from Christopher and Mehdi, this was probably the best money we have spent so far on our trip. \n\nA fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2},

They took her to the chair and put her feet in water. The lady asked her if she wanted her heels scrubbed she said no, just my nails painted black. So all said and done, they put her feet in water and put lotion on her legs and charged her $22 for a pedicure instead of $7 for a paint! I complained and he said she got a pedicure, I repeated that she only asked for her nails to be painted and he said that could mean many things not that she didn't want a pedicure and that Im just mad my daughter spent more money. I said he took advantage of a teenage girl and he said I should know better then to send my teenager there alone!!! Refused to give my money back!

Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.\n\nOur receipt invited us to share our experience at a \"Talk2us\" link, which only produced a \"survey error.\"\n\nHaving had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

On the end, she asked me to look for one of the customers and ask him how they connect. Very bad negative point for me.\nOverall, the salad was okay. To be true, I prefer the Asian Chicken Sesame salad from Panera Bread. The dried noodle was very hard to eat and most of the salad components were cut in chunks instead of niece pieces to eat with a fork. What makes a mess while you are eating. Well... I did not get excited with the food this time. But I intend to come back here again next time that I visit Toronto, I notice other dishes on the menu that called my attention.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Yes\nIs it a good choice for big groups? Maybe\n\nThis is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday.\nThe dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger.\nOverall, the experience was fantastic! The burger was big and juice and not greasy and the fries were delicious too. This is the type of restaurant that I will have as a first option when I go back to the Pittsburgh, PA again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
