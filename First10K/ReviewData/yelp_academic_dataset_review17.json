The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun.

I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest\" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures. It's partially the experience and the thought that an individual at the stove will take our taste buds and our spirit to another level. I will be back at \"The Priest\" someday and am looking forward to giving them 5 stars. God willing. Namaste.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":1},

Not so. The patty is perfectly cooked, juicy, full of flavour. The samosa has great crunch and there is just the right amount of spice. On paper it doesn't work, in your mouth it works wonderfully.

It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!

The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.

Honestly, the work was a hack-job. If you have any really nice\/expensive items of clothing, do NOT take it here or you risk having to get the work re-done elsewhere.

My SO and I had the bruschetta and the frutti de mare pasta. He also served us a complimentary melon and prosciutto appetizer as well as a delicious tiramisu dessert.

However, I haven't gotten a chance to try it until this time at 2011.  \n\nI struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about \"general\" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  \n\nWhy 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  \n\nGood thing the \"Black pepper backed ham\"  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  \n\nOne thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.\n\nI feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    \n\nI tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast \/ bunch.  One for dinner.  \n\nOn the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..\n\nGood luck on your choice and enjoy your meals.  :-)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Occasionally when a second cashier does open she just takes cash or she just takes the last person in line while the people who have been in the line waiting get ignored. One time when this happened I walked over to the cashier and politely told her I was next in line and her comment was 'whatever' and a roll of her eyes. Absolutely no customer service skills. Also, selection is not what I am able to find at other comparable organic stores despite the distance I have to drive to get there. Lastly, the prices here are higher than other places. For example a local nonorganic supermarket down the road has some same products but a few dollars less. Planet organic hikes up their prices probably because they can get away with it I due to the higher end clientele they serve in port credit. I am giving this place no  more 'chances'.

Yes - it's convenient as I live close by - BUT the prices are ridiculous.

Their roast chicken, made on location, is ruined as it is slathered with horrible bbq sauce. In fact, most of their hot meat items are slathered in this sauce. Their customer service is simply deplorable. Their cashiers look miserable and pained even when they have to say the total price of your order. The parking is a mess. Very dangerous. Lastly, and certainly not least, the male employees noticeably come out and circle any good looking girl, woman, lady etc... that walks in to the store. I know this because it happens to me and makes me uncomfortable. They will slowly yet obviously start coming out of the back and the aisles and circle\/pass by you a couple of times.

I spent a lot of time with the person at the front desk, making sure that I was matched with someone who would take the time to get to know me and the hair style that I wanted to achieve.  I was booked the following week with 2 different stylists.  One for hair color and another for a cut.  I showed up ON TIME.  I waited 15 minutes for the the colorist (Lauren) to greet me and start services.  I asked to speak to the lady who was going to cut my hair.  Everyone was rushed and no-one wanted to take the time to get to know me.  The colorist starting applying the color to my hair and informed me that there was not enough time for my hair cut. If I wanted to get my hair cut, I could come back another day or she could cut my hair.  The rudeness was unbelievable.  I was really looking forward to trying a new salon and stylist.  After much discussion, the manager came over and apologized.  I explained that the cut was the most important part of the day. Because there was not enough time for both, I opted to have the color washed out of my hair and have my hair cut with the person (leah) who I was scheduled with for the cut.  I waited 45 minutes for her, which meant I could have continued with the hair color and been fine with timing.  I came back the next day for Leah to color my hair. She barely said 5 words to me.  I paid $20 more for her to color my hair for a total of $85 for a root touch up.  There was NO offer by the salon for compensation for that fact that I had to come back to the salon TWICE.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the attitude of the stylists was appalling.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We arrived a little after 6:30pm, and there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  We waited a few minutes, and then I popped my head around to the bar area, and caught the bartender's attention.  She looked at me and continued talking to two people at the bar.  She didn't bother to acknowledge our presence or to go and get someone to seat us.  The bar area, as well as the restaurant was fairly empty, with just a few tables of customers.  My husband and I continued to wait at the hostess stand, and then we were approached by a customer who wanted to know where the nearest gas station was located, so that he could go get some cigarettes.  Yes, we were standing there that long. I finally walked over to the bar and asked the bartender if we could be seated.  She told me to \"wait a minute\", to which one of the customers told me to relax and wait.  The customer then proceeded to spill a beer all over himself and the bar.  At that point the bartender reluctantly took us to a table.  I asked her to send a manager over to speak to us.  The manager came out and cleaned a table,  glanced our direction, and walked away.  When our server finally came to our table, I asked to speak to the manager.  He came to our table a few minutes later.  I asked if the bartender had let him know that we needed to speak with him,  His response, \"she said that you all had been waiting a while, but didn't tell me that you wanted to talk to me.\"  SERIOUSLY.  What manager would not immediately go apologize to customers who had to wait in an empty restaurant to be seated at a table???  He gave a mild apology.

There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via \"being broken\". Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! \n\nPlaytime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his \"paw\"sonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of imp\"ruff\"ment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for imp\"ruff\"ment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! \n\nGrooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home.

She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say \"stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be\". When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D\n\nAs far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!! I am excited to see what my first purchased item will be someday! \n\nAnnie and Miles are an unstoppable team! Go visit!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I had been telling him for 8 months that we had to go to this theatre because I took the tour, knew about it through work, and just loved the whole idea. My boyfriend is a very \"let's do everything last-minute\" type guy, and so it literally took us that much time to finally get into this theatre for a movie. If you want to go, reserve your spot at least a few days in advance. \n\nAnyway, we finally got in and saw Jack Ryan. The tickets were NOT worth the money to sit in this \"exclusive\" theatre. We decided to make a full date of the experience and also have dinner at the theatre. My boyfriend's food and soda came about 30 minutes before the movie ended (around 9:00pm) and I was not so lucky, my food and water never arrived!!! My boyfriend and I both asked the waiter several times when my food and water would arrive, when we could find him that is, and nothing! I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager. Guess what? A manager NEVER CAME!!! As I told my boyfriend that night, the difference in the comfort of the seats versus a Harkins or AMC is not large enough for me to overlook the extreme disappointment of having to wonder where the waiter is at every moment. I do not even know what happened in the movie!!! That is how preoccupied I got with where the waiter was, where the food was, and if I was even going to have water to drink!!! \n\nAll in all, the seats are comfortable, of course, if not the theatre would not bring in any business, but I strongly recommend that you just invest in a recliner for your home instead. It is way less frustrating!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

I should have known it was not going to be a great experience when I walked in and there're was only one customer. Usually Saturday's at my original salon are packed. I do not recommend.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0},

They went above and beyond making sure he was completely ready before sending him home after the board and train program. I truly enjoy taking him in the car and for walks now. This is what having a pet is all about. I feel so fortunate to have found Willie and Lisa and will forever be thankful! It's honestly worth every penny to invest in training your dog properly. They love what they do and it shows. Thank you again Off Leash K9! Keep up the amazing work! \nRonnie, Parisa & Chance","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Its so hidden that there are no signs in the directory of the restaurant itself except for the line of people waiting to enjoy a slice of the best pizza they ever had.

I wanted to order a latte macchiato, and I don't think the lady at the cashier knew they even have this drink at first. She first put cafe latte on the machine, and I saw it and corrected it. Then I was trying to personalize my drink a bit with less ice and almond milk. After I finished my request, the lady asked me again whether I was ordering a caramel macchiato. I corrected her again that I wanted a latte macchiato. Okay, then it finally showed the right drink on the cashier. I thought this was the end of the story but NO. The guy who was making my drink held a manual with his left hand the entire time while he was making my drink with only his right hand. I even saw him made a mistake at first and started over for my drink. Finally, I got my drink, but the taste was not good as it should taste since I had the same drink several times from another Starbucks store at CU. I understand this is a new Starbucks store, and they are obviously new hires who need a lot of practice. But they clearly need more training before serving real customers. How can employees not even remember the drinks on the menu (I'm definitely not ordering a very wired customized drink)? I hope the manager can pay more attention to the training standards of the employees.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

To be honest, usually pizza is not among the top options when I eat out with friends, but I'm glad we went to this place. Customized pizza, OMG, never thought about we could do this at CU, particularly after so many times of those regular pizzas. Also, I in general prefer thin crust, so this place is perfect for me. The only small problem I have with this place is because they have the oven out, so I think there was a bit of smoke, esp during the rush hour, which made my eyes somehow uncomfortable after seating inside for a while. So I may think about taking out next time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
