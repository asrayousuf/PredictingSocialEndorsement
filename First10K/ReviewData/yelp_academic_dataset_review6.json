People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!

Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.

Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic\/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. \nI could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations.

Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":4},

This is an indoor famer's market, located on Dean Martin in a warehouse.  It runs on Thursdays from 11am-1pm, with a previewing for chefs at 10am.  I found out about this place by eating at one of Batali's restaurants- it's all through word of mouth, they dont advertise.  There is lots of fresh produce including some nice heirloom tomatoes, herbs, lettuce, interesting citrus, etc. though it is not all organic.  Their prices are high, as to be expected.  They do not carry dairy for sale to the public, aside from cheeses sometimes (goat, gouda, and a heavenly buratta that sells out immediately).  You have to be a member of their profit sharing group to purchase the eggs.  There are a couple other vendors that sell coffee, dates, and some hydroponicly grown herbs.

I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. \n\n2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.\n\nOnce you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) \n\nSounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4\/15\/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been \"processed\" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.","useful":50,"funny":2,"cool":3},

Vanna demonstrated such care and love for Cody and we were comforted when we were away knowing he was in the best care.  Vanna has a knack for taking care of multiple dogs at a time, and Cody always had so much fun with her and the other dogs.  She walked her guest dogs many times a day and Cody got more exercise and play than he did with us.  When we returned Cody was always so happy and healthy and he looked like he'd just had a dream 'dogcation'.  Cody would always get excited when we walked towards her place, it was clear he really enjoyed his time with Vanna and her other guest dogs.  Vanna's rates were the lowest in the area too.  If you want your dog get the best exercise, food, love and attention, and a chance to live and play with other dogs (they are pack animals), I very highly recommend Vanna's services.  Cody had a much improved quality of life because of Vanna.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland.

I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! \n\nWith MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told \"no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week\" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.\n\nI don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!\nAngela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! \n\nSo I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. \nOne of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol\nAcross the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   \n\nThe staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!\n\nIn conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:\n\n1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him\n\n2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition \n3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. \n4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!\n\nUPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!","useful":95,"funny":7,"cool":4},

She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, \"yes, I thought that it didn't look right.\"  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, \"I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.\"  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?\n\nMy BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations.

By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.\n\nWe were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.\n\nService was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or \"over-styling.\" Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.\n\nI'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.\n\nIt's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and \"beefy and meaty,\" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. \n\nWe veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.\n\nService was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino\/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. \n\nLastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. \n\nIf you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo\/Venetian Restaurant row.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1},

The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.\n\nWhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.\n\nWe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \n\nAfter ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \n\nFor our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \n\nFor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \n\nAfter some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\n\nThe service was extremely attentive and water refills\/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\nOverall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.\n\nWhat was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2\/3 ice & 1\/3 tea.

Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. \n\nOverall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor. Wish I had a better experience!","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Breakfast is breakfast, but they do it right and its delicious every time.\n\nGet the lyonnaise potatoes with your meal. They're delicious. My personal favorite is the Tex Mex omelette. Guacamole at breakfast time never fails.\n\nThe boardgames on the walls are cute too. :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

The physical therapists are helpful, but compared to other places, are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once. I thought the service was very good until I visited other physical therapists that give much more one-on-one time and assess your progress much more closely.\n\nExample: I was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do. Besides asking how I felt from time to time, they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have. How do they know what is working if they don't assess your progress?","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":1},

The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. \n\nFor a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of Asia.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}]
