There were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids.

It seemed like I was just going through the motions and not really seeing any success.  I liked the trial so much I ended up joining as a member.  There are 3 instructors, all with their own unique style which makes it a nice change and fun to work out.  The workouts are always different and challenging.  The best part to me is all I have to do is show up and give it my all, they have the workout all planned for me, no thinking involved of what do I have to do next.  After a few months of eating right and doing Impact Boot Camp for about 4 days a week I have lost 10.5 lbs and almost 6% body fat.

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!\n\nWe were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. \n\nI had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with \"unlimited\" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). \n\nGoing back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. \n\nTo end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.\n\nGiving it two stars only because it was \"free\" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0},

My wife and I just chuckled. \n\nEntree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! \n\nDessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. \n\nService: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation.

It's appalling, and I feel like I've been personally violated by the whole ordeal.\n\nWhen my Credit Card Bill came, I noticed 2 charges from \"Mandalay Bay\".  I called to find out what the second charge was about and found out that I had apparently been charged over $100 for things from the private bar.   \n\nI travel a lot, and know better than to touch anything in the overpriced bar, when there's the same exact stuff down stairs for much cheaper.  When I asked for a receipt of the itemized charges to be emailed to me.  I never received it.  I called twice to have it emailed, and twice they said they'd do it, and they wouldn't, so I disputed the charge through my Credit Card company.\n\n30 days later, my Credit card was able to receive a copy of the itemized list and below were the items they pretty much made up out of thin air.  \n\n--- half of this stuff, i don't even know what it is.  A \"CD?\"  what the heck.  What would i play it in?  Who plays a CD in Vegas?   I stayed in the room with brothers and sisters, what would I do with a \"Love Kit\".   \n\nThe only thing I could think of would be the personnel taking everything before tidying up the room, and blaming it on me....how would you dispute that?\n\n4 bottles of Fiji water ($5)\n1 Pringles Sour cream ($5)\n2 Orange Juice ($4)\n1 CD ($10)\n1 Travel Kit ($15)\n1 Love Kit ($30)\n2 Cranberry Juice ($4)\n\nIn the end I couldn't do anything because they had my credit card on file for \"incidental\" charges. -- something that's industry standard, but to Arbitrarily charge for everything that was in the room, even if it wasn't used is absolutely NOT standard at all.  It's Shady!\n\nI come to Vegas a lot and have stayed in a good handful of hotels on the strip and have never had any other Hotel chain do this.    From the budget friendly Imperial Palace, to even their very own newest 5 star, the Aria hotel, and not ONCE did any of them try this nonsense.  \n\nFor the many conferences and personal visits to Vegas I shall make, in the future, I will never, ever stay at the Mandalay or TheHotel again.  It's managed by Shady people.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1},

So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8\/26 to watch the Mayweather\/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table\/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables\/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners\/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0},

I have been a book reader all my life. In fact, when I was growing up my parents had an independent bookstore. I am someone that is always buying books. Shortly before Christmas I drove to The Bookshop intending on buying books as Christmas Gifts. I do not smoke in my car and wait until I get somewhere to light up outside. While having my cigarette I was looking through the windows of \"The Bookshop\" prior to entering. The store was empty of customers as usual. A man inside saw me looking at the merchandise through the windows and in a most obnoxious voice came out and told me not to smoke in front of his store.  His arrogant manner and tone of voice implied that I was some sort of vagrant because I was a smoker. I told him \"You just lost a customer.\" Every time I go past there to go to Dick's Hideaway to eat I never see anybody in his book store.  In fact, the other merchants in that strip plaza say they do not know how The Bookshop pays its rent as they never see anybody in there.  I might also add that while looking in the windows I noticed a sign inside the book store that said \"Pets Welcome.\"  Like many Americans I am extremely allergic to dog and cat hair and do not think they should be allowed inside retail businesses unless they are seeing eye dogs.  The Bookshop owners are not considerate of potential customers.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":0},

I have had several procedures done here and have been absolutely pleased with everything.  The overall experience from the front desk to Dr. Hall, to Evelyn the aesthetician has been wonderful.  Everyone is friendly, the facility is state of the art and the results are AMAZING.\n\nI spend a lot of time in the sun and have experienced severe sun damage, primarily the ugly brown sun spots that connect and take over your skin!  After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. \n\nEvelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!\n\nI have also had lipo on my previous  \"baby\" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or \"jiggly\" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  \n\nI am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.

An immediate family member recently had to have a skin cancer removed.  Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.\n\nDr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   \n\nAs a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.  She did have some slight scarring from the acne but thanks to the IPL treatments it really is minimal and undetectable with very little make up.\n\nWe never hesitate to recommend either facility.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0},

Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how \"new\" and \"modern\" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.","useful":12,"funny":1,"cool":2},

So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long.

The truck looked amazing after the body work, it was affordable, and it was done in a timely manner. We also had some brake work done while the body work was being done, and that went well. We definitely feel like Tullock Automotive is an honest, reputable place to take your vehicle and we will be continuing to service our cars with Tullock for years to come.

The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty.

I have trouble understanding why they want to charge so much when they have Groupons for $75. We had a great time with our instructor for our four private lessons we got with our Groupon, but when we wanted to continue on there was just no way we could afford the outrageous prices. After talking with the manager, he still wanted to charge over $100 a lesson. When we were trying to negotiate the price, the manager simply stopped replying to our emails.

My friend and I went to this Whole Foods this past Friday and had the worst experience. While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. \n\nI went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. \n\nAfter this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. \n\nBefore leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. \n\nOnce leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. \n\nIt's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. \n\nOh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0},

I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. \nThe next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. \nMy friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.\nAt 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said \"I do apologize.\" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying \"I do apologize\"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.\n\nWhat a terrible experience. I'm looking at this as a blessing in disguise!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0},

I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic\/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..\n \nEntering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair\/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down\/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station\/massage station separated by a curtain.\nI wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience\/professionalism of the service. Please see below:\n \n1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.\n \n2) Then we went into the massage\/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand\/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??\n \n3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute \"moroccan massage\"-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.\n \n4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.\n \nI really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees\/services?  Really??  \n\nI don't think I will be going back....","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1},

There was a large selection of sandwiches, biscuits and desserts for everyone and it was quite filling. Each bite had a unique and vibrant flavor. I was blown away, everything just tasted so good.\n\nThere is a big variety of teas. We poured ourselves a cup of tea and then rotated our teapots so that we could try everyone's selection. Each tea had its unique aroma and taste.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing, it would be the speed of the service. Our waitress was friendly but there were only two wait staff in the dining area serving a lot of guests at the same, so it took a long time to get our bill and leave. It was an 1 hour and 30 minute seating time but we stayed for 2.5 hours because of the wait.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience and I would love to come back.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1},
